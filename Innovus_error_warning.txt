SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus could not find a path for net '%s' to reach '%s'. If the -topoFile option is
being used, the topology specified for this net is incomplete.
DESCRIPTION
In case automatic feedthrough insertion is being done, it means that a path to some of the terminals
could not be found. If the routeBased option is used, the routing may be incomplete. For the case
the topology file is used an explanation follows.
Tool issues above warning during add_partition_feedthrus command step, when topology file
provided with -topoFile is used to guide the tool for creating the feedthrough in a specified partition
for multi-fanout nets. You will get above warning if the topology file did not define for all the
terminals for a multi-fanout net. Always follow the convention from_pin to to_pin for writing the
topology file.
Example:
If the net goes to three partition A, B and C and you want to make a part of the net from A to D then
to C, then you can use the following approach to write the topology file.
net n123
hinst-hinst A D;
hinst-hinst D C;
hinst-hinst A B;
end net
So, here all the combinations are covered where the net goes, instead of defining the A-D-C.

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus is trying to find a feedthrough path for net %s. It could not find a path to
partition or terminal [%s]. Partitions connected to this net may not be adjacent to each other.
DESCRIPTION
Automatic feedthrough insertion derives the feedthrough topology using the placement. It assumes
a channel-less design. The possibility of routing through channels is considered minimal. In this
design a path to a partition or terminal connected to the above mentioned net could not be found
without avoiding the channels.

SUMMARY
The add_partition_feedthrus command was invoked with the -routeBased option, but the design
has not yet been routed. The add_partition_feedthrus command will skip the nets that are not
routed. Route the design using route_early_global for these nets to be considered for feedthrough
insertion.
DESCRIPTION
The add_partition_feedthrus command invoked with the -routeBased option requires routing for the
net to find a path based on which it will insert the feedthrough ports.
The net reported is not routed so it gets ignored. Route the design prior to running this command.
The route_early_global command can be used to route the design.
Otherwise add_partition_feedthrus should be invoked without using the -routeBased option in
which case the command will try to find a path for the net based on the create_floorplan and
placement (placement based feedthrough insertion).

DESCRIPTION
This warning message is issued while assigning pins on a partition using the Innovus GUI with
Partition => Assign Pin... or when using the assign_partition_pins Tcl command.
The create_floorplan likely contains a problem with routing tracks and/or pin layer definitions. The
problem can be debugged graphically using: Partition => Specify Partition
Select the offending partition and review the Partition Pin Layer Used section. Make sure the layers
defined for pins are included in the Layers Reserved For Partition. Corrections may be made and
applied with this form. Check the min max layer allowed though get_db another reason could be
presence of route blockage or PG on partition edge blocking the routing tracks.
Next, confirm there are preferred routing tracks defined for the pin layers using the Layer Control =>

Error and Warning Messages
Example of ABUTMENT violation on a pin:
---------------------------------------
Pin [pin_1] of partition [ptn_1] connected to net [net_1] is [PLACED] at location (210.452, 540.160)
on layer 8 has ABUTMENT violation WITH partition chip.
In above example error/violation is being reported for partition “ptn_1” pin's “pin_1” which is
connected to net “net_1” and is placed at location “210.452, 540.160” on layer “8” having
assignment status as “placed”. Pin has abutment (is placed on adjoining boundary of “ptn_1” and
“chip”) violation with partition named “chip”. Ideally the pin pair of two adjoining (abutting) partitions
should be placed on same track on edge of partition boundaries, touching each other (abutting).
Abutment violation could be because of following two reasons:
1. Net has multi-partition-pins. Since all other pins of different partitions cannot be placed at same
location (no electrical connection through any overlap of physical shape), so it is reported as
abutment violation.
2. “pin_1” pin of net “net_1” is not connected to any pin of adjoining (abutted) partition “chip”.
List other violations on pin:
- pin min-width violation
- pin min-depth violation
- pin missing metal shape violation
- pin min-area violation
- pin-color violation
- pin not on routing track (or ndr-rule-routing-track) violation
- pin not on fence violation
- pin spacing (drc and spacing constraints) violation
- pin not on allowed layer violation
- For nested partition it checks for child fence area violation
- pin outside pin-guide or bus-guide violation
- Pin associated pin-group or net-group violation

checks for this issue and generate the message as user may forget to set min/max layer of pin when
it differs from route_early_global.

The hierarchical-PG net %s is connected to an instance term %s inside the partition hinst %s.
However, it is not connected to any PG port of the partition hinst. This is erroneous data. As a

DESCRIPTION
Reason of such incorrect PG net connection is generally introduced by either incorrect UPF or
incorrect GNC rule. To correct this error, ensure that the above net is connected to a partition PG
port when connecting to an instance PG term inside partition. Or, if this connection is not needed
inside the partition hinst, then ensure that the net does not connect to any of the PG terms inside the

provided with -topoFile is used to guide the tool for creating the feedthrough in a specified partition
for multi-fanout nets. You will get above warning if the topology file did not define for all the
terminals for a multi-fanout net. Always follow the convention from_pin to to_pin for writing the
topology file.
Example:
If the net goes to three partition A, B and C and you want to make a part of the net from A to D then
to C, then you can use the following approach to write the topology file.
net n123
hinst-hinst A D;
hinst-hinst D C;

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus is trying to find a feedthrough path for net %s. It could not find a path to
partition or terminal [%s]. Partitions connected to this net may not be adjacent to each other.
DESCRIPTION
Automatic feedthrough insertion derives the feedthrough topology using the placement. It assumes
a channel-less design. The possibility of routing through channels is considered minimal. In this
design a path to a partition or terminal connected to the above mentioned net could not be found
without avoiding the channels.

NAME
CHKPTNPIN-647
SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus skipping net [%s] because a path to some of the partitions or terminals
could not be found. It might not be necessary to insert feedthrough buffers for this net. If you wish to
insert feedthrough buffers for this net, then use the topology file for guided feedthrough buffer
insertion or use the -routeBased option after routing the net.

DESCRIPTION
add_partition_feedthrus assumes the design to be channel-less and partitions to be in the line of
sight for feedthrough path to pass from one partition to another. In case of channel based designs
where this is not true, the named net is ignored. In case feedthrough insertion is required for the net,
either route the design and used add_partition_feedthrus -routeBased or define the path for the net
in a topology file and use add_partition_feedthrus -topoFile <filename>
Example:
--------
route_early_global
add_partition_feedthrus -routeBased

SUMMARY
The add_partition_feedthrus command was invoked with the -routeBased option, but the design
has not yet been routed. The add_partition_feedthrus command will skip the nets that are not
routed. Route the design using route_early_global for these nets to be considered for feedthrough
insertion.
DESCRIPTION
The add_partition_feedthrus command invoked with the -routeBased option requires routing for the
net to find a path based on which it will insert the feedthrough ports.
The net reported is not routed so it gets ignored. Route the design prior to running this command.
The route_early_global command can be used to route the design.
Otherwise add_partition_feedthrus should be invoked without using the -routeBased option in
which case the command will try to find a path for the net based on the create_floorplan and
placement (placement based feedthrough insertion).

Error and Warning Messages
DESCRIPTION
This warning message is issued while assigning pins on a partition using the Innovus GUI with
Partition => Assign Pin... or when using the assign_partition_pins Tcl command.
The create_floorplan likely contains a problem with routing tracks and/or pin layer definitions. The
problem can be debugged graphically using: Partition => Specify Partition
Select the offending partition and review the Partition Pin Layer Used section. Make sure the layers
defined for pins are included in the Layers Reserved For Partition. Corrections may be made and
applied with this form. Check the min max layer allowed though get_db another reason could be
presence of route blockage or PG on partition edge blocking the routing tracks.
Next, confirm there are preferred routing tracks defined for the pin layers using the Layer Control =>
Track => Pref Track and the Wire&Via layer defined for the pins. If the tracks are incorrect, they may
be regenerated using the "generateTracks" Tcl command.
Example:
get_pin_constraint -cell c -side all -layer
Constraint on partition c :
Allowed layer on side [top] : 2 4 6
Allowed layer on side [left] : 3 5
Allowed layer on side [bottom] : 2 4 6
Allowed layer on side [right] : 3 5

design_bottom_routing_layer 2 # string, default=""
design_top_routing_layer 15 # string, default=""

Look for the Tracks in a section with: Track:
While corrections can be made to the tmp.fp file and reloaded with the "read_floorplan tmp.fp" Tcl
command, it is generally easier to do make changes with the Innovus GUI.

SUMMARY
Pin [%s] of %s [%s] connected to net [%s] is [%s] at location (%8.3f, %8.3f) on layer %1d %s.
DESCRIPTION
Message reports specific error/violation on a partition pin.
Example of ABUTMENT violation on a pin:
---------------------------------------
Pin [pin_1] of partition [ptn_1] connected to net [net_1] is [PLACED] at location (210.452, 540.160)
on layer 8 has ABUTMENT violation WITH partition chip.
In above example error/violation is being reported for partition “ptn_1” pin's “pin_1” which is
connected to net “net_1” and is placed at location “210.452, 540.160” on layer “8” having
assignment status as “placed”. Pin has abutment (is placed on adjoining boundary of “ptn_1” and
“chip”) violation with partition named “chip”. Ideally the pin pair of two adjoining (abutting) partitions
should be placed on same track on edge of partition boundaries, touching each other (abutting).
Abutment violation could be because of following two reasons:
1. Net has multi-partition-pins. Since all other pins of different partitions cannot be placed at same
location (no electrical connection through any overlap of physical shape), so it is reported as
abutment violation.
2. “pin_1” pin of net “net_1” is not connected to any pin of adjoining (abutted) partition “chip”.

- pin min-width violation
- pin min-depth violation
- pin missing metal shape violation

above net is connected to a partition PG port when connecting to an instance PG term inside the
partition, and run the command again.
DESCRIPTION
Reason of such incorrect PG net connection is generally introduced by either incorrect UPF or
incorrect GNC rule. To correct this error, ensure that the above net is connected to a partition PG
port when connecting to an instance PG term inside partition. Or, if this connection is not needed
inside the partition hinst, then ensure that the net does not connect to any of the PG terms inside the

SUMMARY
Failed to read in timing data, check timing constraint or library, set timingDriven false.
DESCRIPTION
plan_design command in Innovus generates a quick, initial create_floorplan that can be used as a
starting point for making the final create_floorplan. Use the plan_design command to create multiple
alternative floorplans. User can then test the floorplans to find the one that gives the best placement
and routing results. PlanDesign can be run in timingDrivenMode. By default, Automatic Floorplan
Synthesis takes timing constraints into account during create_floorplan generation, if timing libraries
(.lib) and SDC constraint files are loaded in the design. It will not perform timing aware floorplanning
if either the timing library or constraint file is not loaded, and if either liberty or constraint file is
missing plan_design would issue the warning message : "Failed to read in timing data, check
timing constraint or library, set timingDriven false." This warning message is added to tell user the
reason is that the timing data is lacking or not colmplete.

-timing is ignored in low effort.
DESCRIPTION
Command analyze_floorplan with low effort provides cluster mode placement (non-timing driven).
This results in low analysis accuracy, but a fast run time. Option '-timing' is ignored in low effort

DESCRIPTION
In Flex-model flow, analyze_floorplan -timing is running by 4 iterations of timing-driven route_trial
by default. During the flex model flow the first call to analyze_floorplan is recommended to use
analyze_floorplan -cong (instead of -timing) to run route_trial only once and make sure quickly that
your design is routable.

SUMMARY
Did not meet the max transition constraint. %s
DESCRIPTION
Failure to meet a maximum transition time constraint in the clock tree network usually occurs
because:
- Specified transition time is too low. Use 'get_db cts_target_max_transition_time' to check the
global setting, and 'get_db clock_tree:<clk> .cts_target_max_transition_time' to check the setting on
each clock tree. Use 'report_clock_trees' to get a list of violating pins, then check the dont_touch
attribute on the attached net.
- A net cannot be buffered because it has been marked dont_touch. Use 'report_clock_trees' to get
a list of violating pins, then check the dont_touch attribute on the attached net.
- A net cannot be buffered because some aspect of the floorplan (power domains, blockages,
March 2020 143 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
regions, macros or other fixed instances), prevent placement of buffers.
- Detailed routing of the clock tree has produced routing detours, or excessive numbers of small
jogs with vias.
For floorplan and/or routing issues, find the offending net(s) with 'report_clock_trees' as above, and
observe the floorplan where the net has been routed.
IMPCCOPT-1013
NAME
IMPCCOPT-1013
SUMMARY
The cts_target_max_transition_time is too low for at least one clock tree, net type and timing corner.
Search the log for the string 'Too low;' to find the minimum acceptable targets for each combination.
CTS will now terminate.
DESCRIPTION
This usually occurs because:
- The transition time specified has no units specified. For example a user may specify a transition
time target of 0.1, not realizing that the library units are ps. In this case, specify the units explicitly
(0.1ns instead of 0.1).
- The specified list of clock tree cells (buffers, inverters, clock gates) is very weak. Use
'check_cts_config' to obtain a list of clock tree cells used, and check their drive strength.
If you have reason to believe this is not a problem in your design (eg. it only applies to one power
domain which does not need buffering), then the test can be overridden with the attribute
cts_exit_if_transition_target_over_constrained. Forcing CTS to proceed with a value that is too low
here may cause long runtimes.

In power domain %s, CTS has found that %s can drive %lfcm of wire. This will effectively result in
CTS ignoring placement. %s
DESCRIPTION
CTS timing code has found that a single buffer can drive a huge amount of wire in a given power
domain. This could be caused by one or more of the following:
1) The layer technology information in the LEF file(s) might be missing or incorrect.
2) An operating condition might be incorrectly configured or using incorrect library data.
3) A capacitance or resistance multiplier may be set incorrectly.
4) The QRC technology file (or captables if no QRC technology file is present) is incorrect.
5) A buffer cell may be poorly characterized.
6) The SDC file and .lib files may be in different time or capacitance units.

March 2020 145 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
DESCRIPTION
Clock tree synthesis requires at least one buffer cell and one inverter cell to start. When these
cannot be found, there are several possible causes:
-There is no explicit cell list set, and all of the clock tree buffers and inverters in the library are
marked dont_Use. Either set an explicit list of cells, or mark the clock tree cells needed as
'dont_Use false' (see examples below).
If you have set an explicit list of cells, this message could occur because:
1.the cells listed are missing descriptions in one more analysis views.
2.the cells listed are not usable in a power domain where the named clock tree must be buffered.
3.none of the cells listed have balanced rise/fall characteristics.
For Example:
To designate an explicit lists of cells as buffer cells, inverter cells (NOTE:Both should be set in all
cases):
set_db cts_buffer_cells <cell list> [-clock_tree <name>]
set_db cts_inverter_cells <cell list> [-clock_tree <name>]

DESCRIPTION
The user can specify the skew limit on specific skew groups (explore set_db cts_target_skew).
Failure to meet this constraint could occur because the skew limit target (set by the CCOpt property
cts_target_skew) is too tight for CTS to achieve. If that target is reasonable, then check the result of
'report_skew_groups' for the following items:
1. One or more nets in the clock tree are unbufferable.
2. Poor availability of clock tree buffer/inverter cells.
3. A skew target had to be slackened off due to conflicts with other skew groups. Check the log file
for messages containing the phrase 'slackened off'.

DESCRIPTION
This warning at the end of the CCOpt run indicates that the max_capacitance constraint is not met

This could happen for the following reasons:
1. Inappropriate max_capacitance constraint on clock tree cells (too tight to be achieved).
2. One or more of the nets in the clock tree are unbufferable, due to power_domain, blockages,
region constraints or dont_touch settings.
3. Congestion has yielded detoured nets during detailed routing of the clock nets.
4. The clock tree has a very large load (such as memory, hard blocks) that exceeds the
max_capacitance limit on its own.

SUMMARY
CTS has set the cts_opt_ignore attribute on clock tree %s. This clock tree cannot be synthesized. It
is most likely that there are no buffers or inverters available for this clock tree, or this clock tree is in
a dont_touch module or all nets in this clock tree are dont_touch or this clock tree is in an
unbufferable or fully blocked power-domain.
DESCRIPTION
CTS has set the cts_opt_ignore attribute on the cts_clock_tree. This clock tree cannot be
synthesized.
This may have occurred for any/all of the following reasons:
1) All nets in the clock tree are dont_touch.
2) The clock tree is in a dont_touch module.
3) The clock tree is in an unbufferable or fully-blocked power-domain.
4) There are no buffers or inverters available to use for the clock tree. You may be able to fix this
issue by specifying base_cells for CTS to use, with the cts_buffer_cells and cts_inverter_cells
attributes on this clock tree.

SUMMARY
Non-leaf slew time target of %s%s is too low on %s. The largest %sclock gate is unable to drive the
largest %s in %s. To adhere to the given slope target, you will need to select a stronger clock gate,
increase the slew target to at least %s or remove these driver cells from the CTS cell lists: %s %s.
DESCRIPTION
Slope/slew/transition target for the clock tree is too small.
March 2020 161 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
CCOpt calculates the slew that arises when you drive a buffer/inverter with a single other
buffer/inverter with no wire present between them. If the supplied slew target is smaller than this
computed transition time then CTS has no chance of driving multiple buffers so this error is
produced and the run stopped.
Increase the slew target to something bigger.

DESCRIPTION
CCOpt has updated an 'ignore' skew target for late timing in the CTS primary delay corner for a
skew group because it has non ignored targets in another corner. If you are trying to do CTS for a
design where a skew group should explicitly not be balanced in the primary delay corner, such as
for a design which uses dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), then you can turn off this
behavior by setting the cts_allow_ignore_skew_in_primary_corner_for_mmmc attribute to true.

DESCRIPTION
This message appears when a cell has been found to be unable to drive enough capacitance at a
particular frequency. This is determined from the frequency dependent max cap defined in the lib

IMPCCOPT-2347
SUMMARY
Could not build any timing models for the generated clock tree %s (output pin %s, library cell pin
%s). Clock tree timing may be inaccurate.
DESCRIPTION
This message appears when CCOpt is unable to set up a timing model for the specified output pin
and may be caused by e.g. missing timing arcs for that pin in the Liberty data for one or more
analysis views. This will prevent the tool from correctly determining the transition time and delay at
the specified output pin and may lead to inaccurate optimization and reporting of delays and DRVs.
To avoid this situation, the Liberty timing data (.lib data) must be checked and corrected to ensure
arcs are present for the library pin in question for all analysis views. Alternatively, consider setting
the attribute cts_clock_tree_source_output_max_transition_time.
More detailed reporting of which timing arcs are missing is avialable in the 'Missing Timing Arcs'
table produced by report_clock_trees.

To resolve this error, either disable pre-CTS useful skew entirely, or else set the specified attribute
back to its default value.

SUMMARY
The SDC clock %s has source pin %s, which drives a net that has other drivers. Clock trees for this
clock will be defined on the fanout pins of the net instead.
DESCRIPTION
The pin (or port) referenced in an SDC create_clock or create_generated_clock is an output pin
driving a net that has multiple drivers. CTS cannot build a clock tree rooted at that pin because it is
not possible to control the delay since the other drivers of the net are not in the clock tree. CTS will
move the clock tree and skew group definitions to the fanout pins, creating a skew group with
multiple sources if needed to ensure that the entire transitive fanout of the original pin is included.
To eliminate this message, change the SDC to avoid defining clocks on pins whose driven nets

March 2020 202 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
DESCRIPTION
attributes cts_sink_type and cts_pin_insertion_delay affect how the clock trees are traced through
the nelist. For this reason, attempting to set such a attribute on a non-sink pin in a clock tree is an
error.
It is generally recommended to apply cts_sink_type and cts_pin_insertion_delay settings to non-
sink pins before creating the clock spec.
However, to make such a setting on a given pin after a spec has been created: first delete the
affected clock trees; next apply the setting; and lastly re-create the deleted clock trees. Note that as
a consequence of the setting, the re-created clock trees will treat the given pin a clock sink, and will
no longer trace past it.

SUMMARY
Clock %s has been synthesized. Type 'man ENCCK-209' to see extended message about this
warning.
DESCRIPTION
This message indicates Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) thinks this clock
tree has already been built and, therefore, will not run. The reason
it thinks clock has been synthesized is explained in one of the mes-
sages that precede it. For example, if a clock buffer or excluded cell
is found on the clock net while tracing it, it will issue an ENCCK-766 or
ENCCK-767 message and stop. In order to run CTS you must delete the
existing clock tree first.
When running clockDesign it will automatically call deleteClockTree at beginning
to remove buffers on the clock. However deleteClockTree cannot remove fixed
instances. You should run following command to unfix existing buffers on the clock
so deleteClockTree can remove them:
changeClockStatus -clk clockName -noFixedNetWires -noFixedBuffers

This will set status to Placed for all buffers and wires in the specified

this operation on all clocks defined in the CTS specification file. Once you
change the status to Placed, deleteClockTree will be able to remove all existing
buffers in the clock tree.

SUMMARY
The parameter '-localSkew' is not supported in Multi-Corner CTS. To run ckECO -localSkew on a
single corner, specify the same analysis view for both setup and hold. For example, if the desired
analysis view is func_worst, then do "set_analysis_view -setup func_worst -hold func_worst" and
reload the clock spec file.
DESCRIPTION
The above error is generated in Innovus when trying to run command "ckECO -localSkew" in
MMMC mode.
What is the recommended way to run "ckECO -localSkew" in MMMC mode?
By default, CTS attempts to optimize across all active setup and hold views.
The -localSkew parameter of ckECO does not support this, and hence the above error is generated.
The workaround is to run "ckECO -localSkew" for a single setup view. Select the setup view which
you want to target and specify this view for both setup and hold.
Example:
set_analysis_view -setup setup_func -hold setup_func

SUMMARY
Find excluded cell %s in the clock tree.
DESCRIPTION
This message indicates an excluded cell was found downstream of from the clock
root you are trying to synthesize. Therefore, Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) will
not run. Avoid this warning by deleting the clock tree prior to CTS using the
deleteClockTree command. clockDesign automatically runs deleteClockTree before
tracing the clock but deleteClockTree cannot remove fixed instances. Therefore,
you should run the following to unfix the clock tree so deleteClockTree can
remove the existing buffers in the tree:
changeClockStatus -clk clockName -noFixedNetWires -noFixedBuffers
This will set the placement status to Placed for all buffers and wires in the
specified clock tree. You can use the -all option in place of -clk clockName to
perform this on all clocks defined in the CTS specification file. Once you
set the status to Placed, deleteBufferTree will be able to remove these
existing buffers in the tree.

IMPCK-767
NAME
IMPCK-767
SUMMARY
Find clock buffer %s in the clock tree.
DESCRIPTION
This message indicates a clock tree buffer was found downstream from the clock
root you are trying to synthesize. Therefore, Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) will
not run. Avoid this warning by deleting the clock tree prior to CTS using the
deleteClockTree command. clockDesign automatically runs deleteClockTree before
tracing the clock but deleteClockTree cannot remove fixed instances. Therefore,
you should run the following to unfix the clock tree so deleteClockTree can
remove the existing buffers in the tree:
changeClockStatus -clk clockName -noFixedNetWires -noFixedBuffers
This will set the placement status to Placed for all buffers and wires in the
specified clock tree. You can use the -all option in place of -clk clockName to
perform this on all clocks defined in the CTS specification file. Once you
set the status to Placed, deleteBufferTree will be able to remove these
existing buffers in the tree.
Alternatively, if you prefer to preserve portions of the clock tree and
synthesize the rest you can use PreservePin. PreservePin preserves the netlist
for the pin and pins below the pin in the clock tree. However, CTS considers
any synchronized pins after the pin when computing skew. For example:

SUMMARY
Clock %s has a maximum of %d levels of logic before synthesis. Sample path: %s
DESCRIPTION
This will make ckSynthesis difficult to balance all sinks and achieve reasonable skew.
Please check those deeply gated clock paths to see if any tracing directive (for example, LeafPin,
ExcludedPin, SetDPinAsSync NO) is necessary, but missed from clock spec file.
IMPCK-6336
NAME
IMPCK-6336
SUMMARY
Clock %s contains equivalent gates that have bounding boxes of their downstream leaf pins
overlapped. This is most probably caused by cloning without adequate placement information. Use
one clock gate to drive all leaf pins, or, division of leaf pins based on physical locations between
clock gates may help improve this situation.
DESCRIPTION
This warning is part of the new CTS diagnostic feature which is designed to highlight potential

issues or inefficiencies in the clock setup.
It is issued by clock gating instance location check at pre-synthesis stage.
The message means that two (or more) cloned gates are driving registers in a common area where
the bounding boxes of downstream sinks overlap each other physically. This can lead to poor QoR.
A possible reason for that is previous clock gate cloning was not done properly, therefore they could
be good candidates for decloning/cloning by performing ckDecloneGate followed by ckCloneGate
on suggested gating instances.
Either one gate could drive all the registers here or the division of the registers between the clock
gates could be done better.

Error and Warning Messages
This error message happens when a CPF object is used without defining or fails
to define it. Check the CPF file for the definition/creating of the object. And
also look for any error/warn messages prior to this error.
For example, if 'create_power_domain' command errors out due to some reason,
the later 'update_power_domain' will give this error because the power domain
it tries to update is not defined. Please also pay attention to the command
order in the CPF file. If some object is defined after it's used, tool will
also give this error message.
Example:
--------
**ERROR: (IMPCPF-209): line 453: power_domain PD_off is not defined.

DESCRIPTION
Encounter 13.1 release onwards, tool issues above error message if library
sets are not defined in CPF. The library sets can be defined either
using viewdefinition.tcl file or using define_library_set command in
CPF. The library sets defined in CPF can be further associated to
nominal condition as shown below:
create_nominal_condition -name off -voltage 0 -ground_voltage 0.0 -state_off
update_nominal_condition -name off -library_set <lib set name >
But, if the library sets are not defined in CPF, then CPF will issue
above error message while executing create_power_mode command:

SUMMARY
lLibrary file %s of library_set %s used in the CPF file is not loaded from viewDefinition file. It's
caused by inconsistent library_set definition in CPF and viewDefinition file.
DESCRIPTION
Library set in the CPF file needs to contain the same library files as in the viewDefinition file.
This message is reported when CPF file loads a library file that is not loaded into Innovus
by viewDefinition file during design initialization.
To solve it, check the library set definitions in CPF and viewDefinition files and
make sure them consistent.
A good practice is to define library file paths in a separate file and use variable
in CPF and viewDefinition file so that they will always be consistent.

DESCRIPTION
In the CPF file, power mode used in 'create_analysis_view' command must have
SDC file specified. Because commit_power_intent will convert the power mode into
constraint mode and it needs to know the SDC file. To specify, use the
update_power_mode command.

SUMMARY
line %s: create_isolation_rule -name %s: Can not find an isolation cell with a valid location domain
%s and with the isolation output state %s. The possible reasons are: 1) the specified location in
update_isolation_rule is different from the location in define_isolation_cell, or 2) the output state for
the valid isolation cell does not match to its output state specified in create_isolation_rule.
DESCRIPTION
The message shows that Innovus cannot insert an isolation cell with a valid
location and with required isolation_output state. The reasons could be:
1. The rule-specified location is different from the valid location
specified in define_isolation_cell. For example:
define_isolation_cell -cells isoandlow_f2_pm -valid_location on
create_isolation_rule -name VDD2LSW1_iso_low_from \\

Error and Warning Messages
-from PD_VDD2LSW1
update_isolation_rules -names VDD2LSW1_iso_low_from \\
-location from -cells {isoandlow_f*_pm}
The rule specifies "-location from" (PD_VDD2LSW1 is a switchable power
domain) and "-cells isoandlow_f*_pm". But all the isolation cells
isoandlow_f*_pm are specified as "-valid_location on" which means the
isolation cells are to be placed in an unswitched domain.
Therefore these isoandlow_f*_pm cells do not fit this rule.
If the rule specifies "-location to" in this case, then these cells
would fit the rule.
2. No valid cell can match the rule's output state requirement when
the isolation_condition is asserted. For example,
create_isolation_rule -name iso_low -isolation_output low
update_isolation_rules -names iso_low -cells {isonandhigh*_pm}
There are no isolation cells matching the name isonandhigh*_pm with
isolation_output low. Therefore the message of CPF-251 is issued.
Verify the cell name and confirm a cell exists which matches the cell
specified and also matches the required isolation_output state.

library defining those cells are not loaded while executing init_design. Please check this domain
library binding.
DESCRIPTION
This is caused by library which defining those cells are not loaded or binding to domain.
you need to check domain's library binding in view_definition.tcl file.
In view_definition.tcl file, we use command "update_delay_corner -power_domain -library_set"
to specify domain's library.
Example:
In view_definition.tcl:
Only have : "create_delay_corner -name -library_set -rc_corner"
No "update_delay_corner -power_domain -library_set"
There are two solutions:
1. You need to modify this mmmc file by adding "update_delay_corner
-power_domain -library_set" to specify the domain's library binding.
or
2. In foundation flow,do NOT specify the mmmc file and let CPF to set up the
MMMC. in the file FF/init.tcl,specify the init_mmmc_file to an empty string "".
then commit_power_intent will setup the MMMC based on the CPF spec and the domain library

SUMMARY
The constraint mode of this inactive view '%s' has been modified and may need to be reanalyzed to
ensure proper timing results. To reanalyze timing for this view make the view active using
'set_analysis_view' and run timing analysis.
DESCRIPTION
This warning message appears when 2 or more views are sharing the same constraint mode in the
design and also the constraints are changed. For example, In a design, say totally 9 analysis views
are created and all these views are sharing the same constraint mode "delay_constraints" and
currently 2 views are in active state,Now, when there is a change in the constraint modes in form of
some constraint change , tool is trying to make these changes to all of the inactive views. Hence the
warning message clearly shows that the constraint mode has been modified and the particular
inactive view should be re-analyzed to make proper timing analysis. There won't be any harm on
proceeding further on the design steps.

SUMMARY
'%s' is not a legal attribute name, you probably have a typo. If it was not intended as an attribute
name, you can hide it inside a tcl variable and use the variable instead in the dbget expression. You
can use 'dbGet <object>.?h' to get list of all supported objects and attributes.
DESCRIPTION
You may meet unexpected error in dbGet pattern matching if the pattern contains decimal point. For
example:
> dbGet top.insts.instTerms.name {U1[0].test/SE}
**ERROR: (IMPDBTCL-229): 'test' is not a legal attribute name, you probably have a typo. If it was
not intended as an attribute name, you can hide it inside a tcl variable and use the variable instead
in the dbget expression. You can use 'dbGet <object>.?h' to get list of all supported objects and

If the decimal point is escaped it works:
> dbGet top.insts.instTerms.name {U1[0]\\.test/SE}
{U1[0].test/SE}
But problems arise again if the result is used in a variable:
> set termName [lindex [dbGet top.insts.instTerms.name {U1[0]\\.test/SE}] 0]

SUMMARY
Line %ld: OffMGrid: %s (%d, %d) (%d, %d) %s %s is not on Manufacturing Grid.
DESCRIPTION
This error reports that a wire's coordinate in the DEF file are not on the manufacturing grid which
will result in DRC errors.
The coordinates in the error message are in database units per micron (dbuPerMicron). Look for the
following line in the DEF file to determine how many dbu's is 1 micron:
UNITS DISTANCE MICRONS dbuPerMicron ;
When reading DEF Innovus System will check that each edge and the center-line of wires is on the
manufacturing grid defined in the technology LEF file (MANUFACTURINGGRID).
One possible scenario that could cause this issue is that the two edges of the wire are on
manufacturing grid but the center line, which is what DEF syntax uses, may not be. To check if your
dbu's have enough granularity, multiply dbuPerMicron * manufaturingGrid. The result should be an
March 2020 253 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
integer quantity that is evenly divisible by two to ensure the center-line is on grid.
For example, if MANUFACTURINGGRID is 0.005, this is only achievable with a DBU of 2000.
- (1000*0.005)/2 = 2.5, (not evenly divisible by two), the result could be off manufacturing grid.
- (2000*0.005)/2 = 5, (evenly divisible by two), the result will be on manufacturing grid.
Or to say it another way:
If dbuPerMicron * manufacturingGrid is an odd number (e.g. 1000*0.005 = 5), you cannot create a
path (center-line based) that has a width that is an odd number of manufacturing grids wide.

SUMMARY
The routing has wire-patches (that requires DEF 5.8 NETS RECT statements) in the signal routing
that cannot be represented correctly in DEF 5.6 or 5.7. They will be converted to SPECIALNETS
routing RECT shapes instead. This output is suitable for RC extraction tools, but this DEF should
not be read back into Innovus as the routing data will not be correct. You should use DEF 5.8 to
represent this routing data correctly by using "set_db write_def_lef_out_version 5.8".
DESCRIPTION
Wire-patches are a new DEF 5.8 concept that allows a rectangle to be added in the NETS symbolic
routing section. They are commonly used to add a small amount of metal to fix minimum-area
violations, or fill in notch violations, etc.
DEF 5.6 or 5.7 has no NETS syntax for these shapes, so they can only be written to the
SPECIALNETS section using RECT syntax. If you read this DEF back into Innovus these shapes
will be special-route shapes, and the signal router will not be able to rip up or repair them. You will
need to remove them with a script.

SUMMARY
%s at ( %d %d ) on net '%s' has been found with unknown routing status so it is ignored.
DESCRIPTION
Routes or vias should have a route status (routed, fixed, cover, noshield) in order for write_def to
write them to DEF. Routes with the unknown status are normally created by earlyGlobalRoute, and
the net is marked isEarlyGlobalRouted and they are silently ignored by write_def unless you use
the write_def -early_global_route option.
In some cases optimization may add some routes with the unknown status on nets that are not
marked isEarlyGlobalRouted that will be repaired by the router later in the flow. It is also possible
the user has added some routes manually or through scripts with the unknown status. This warning
is caused by these types of routes, and write_def will not write them out by default.
You can avoid this warning by using the -early_global_route option to force the unknown status
routes to be written as "routed" status in the DEF, or by not using the -routing option so NETS
section routing is not written at all.

SUMMARY
The routing has wire-patches (that require DEF 5.8 NETS RECT statements) in the signal routing
that cannot be represented in DEF 5.5. They will be lost and the routing data will be incomplete with
missing shapes, because there is no DEF 5.5 syntax that can correctly represent them. You should
use DEF 5.8 to represent this routing data correctly by using "set_db write_def_lef_out_version

DESCRIPTION
Wire-patches are a new DEF 5.8 concept that allows a rectangle to be added in the NETS symbolic
routing section. They are commonly used to add a small amount of metal to fix minimum-area
violations, or fill in notch violations, etc.
DEF 5.5 has no NETS or SPECIALNETS syntax that can represent these shapes. If you read this
DEF back into Innovus the missing shapes will cause DRC violations, and other problems. You will
need to remove the signal routing and then run the router again or try to use ECO routing
commands to repair them.

setting 'set_db si_delay_enable_report true' before timing analysis.
DESCRIPTION
The nets identified as having bumpy transitions are the nets which have a reverse swing of more
than 30 percent of Vdd in their transitions. High crosstalk on such nets is the source of such bumpy
transitions, and should be fixed to ensure accurate delay computation.

SUMMARY
Since number of unique setup and hold (active) views '%d' is greater than '%d', which is the amount
of usable CPU set through %s command, some views will be timed sequentially and final summary
report will be based on opt_signoff internal estimated timing.
DESCRIPTION
When no ECO Timing DB are provided through the set_db opt_signoff_read_eco_opt_db option,
the opt_signoff command will generate those automatically using the distributed MMMC
infrastructure.
In case number of active views is greater than number of available hosts, some views will be timed
sequentially, which will result in more runtime but also the final summary report will be based on
opt_signoff internal estimated timing.
To avoid this situation, it is recommended to enable equal or more hosts than the number of active
views when relying on opt_signoff to generate the ECO Timing DB.
Example:
Here is an example to enable 6 remote hosts, each one using 4 threads, for timing analysis :

SUMMARY
Detected %d nets with incomplete RC network. Low-value resistances have been added by the
software to complete the RC network of these nets. Review the list of affected nets in the '%s' file to
ensure they are not along the critical path because results of timing analysis performed on nets with
incomplete RC network can be inaccurate.
DESCRIPTION
This warning is displayed when the SPEF file contains incomplete RC network connectivity for
some nets. This can also happen if a net occurring before a given net in the SPEF file has a
coupling capacitance to a node that is not referenced in the resistance section of the given net.
While computing the delay of a net, if the RC network in the SPEF file is incomplete, there will be
no resistance path from the driver to the receiver of the net. As a result, the receiver will never
switch in simulation and this will result in incorrect delay computation. Therefore, the software adds
a low-value resistance to establish a resistance path from the driver to the receiver of the net so that
the delay of the net can be computed correctly. To avoid this warning, ensure that the SPEF file has
the complete RC network for all the nets.

SUMMARY
The process node is not set. Use the command set_design_mode -process <process node> prior to
extraction for maximum accuracy and optimal automatic threshold setting.
DESCRIPTION
Cadence recommends always using set_design_mode to specify the process technology. It
controls many default settings that are used by implementation and analysis engines within Innovus
System. For analysis purposes, the best results depend on using different RC extraction thresholds
going from 130nm to 90nm, or from 65nm to 45nm. set_design_mode -process recognizes nodes
from 10 to 250 (nm), with 90 as the default. Use get_design_mode to query the current settings.

SUMMARY
Initialization for preRoute extraction mode using the technology file is being terminated since the
technology file '%s' could not be read. This is because it is either an invalid file or an error occurred
in importing it. Check the file and read it in again using create_rc_corner or update_rc_corner -
qx_tech_file.

Interconnect Technology input file) using TechGen.
IMPEXT-6191
NAME
IMPEXT-6191
SUMMARY
Using a captable file is not recommended for process nodes less than or equal to %d nm due to
parasitic accuracy concerns. The Quantus QRC technology file should be specified for all RC
corners using the command create_rc_corner or update_rc_corner, which will then be used for
pre_route and post_route(effort level medium or high or signoff) extraction engines.

IMPEXT-6195
NAME
IMPEXT-6195
SUMMARY
The low effort level for post_route extraction mode will be ignored because it is not allowed for the
current multi-corner setup. This is because either flow is without a cap table, or the design process
node is less than or equal to 32 nm and cap tables are not specified for all the active RC corners.
To avoid this, switch to extract_rc_effort_level medium or high or signoff, if Quantus QRC techfile(s)
are available.
DESCRIPTION
For more information, see the "RC Extraction > PreRoute Extraction Flow without Capacitance
Table data" User Guide.
IMPEXT-6197
NAME
IMPEXT-6197
SUMMARY
The Cap table file is not specified. This will result in lower parasitic accuracy when using pre_route
extraction or post_route extraction with effort level 'low'. It is recommended to generate the Cap
table file using the 'write_cap_table' command and specify it before extraction using
'create_rc_corner/update_rc_corner -cap_table'.
March 2020 305 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
DESCRIPTION
If Cap table file is not available, user can generate it using 'write_cap_table –ict [-lef]'. For pre_route
extraction on 32nm and below designs, or post_route extraction under 65nm, Quantus QRC
technology files are more accurate than the Cap table. User can specify them with 'create_rc_corner
or update_rc_corner -qx_tech_file' if Quantus QRC technology files are available. For post_route
extraction with available Quantus QRC tech files the 'set_db extract_rc_effort_level' should then be
updated to 'medium or high or signoff'.
IMPEXT-6198
NAME
IMPEXT-6198
SUMMARY
Extraction will not take place because the technology file is not specified for all RC corners.
Technology files are needed for pre_route extraction and effort level medium or high or signoff of
post_route extraction when the process node set using set set_design_mode -process is less than
or equal to %d nm. Use the commands create_rc_corner or update_rc_corner to specify the
technology file for all corners and run the extraction again.
DESCRIPTION
In MMMC based flow, the qrcTechFile is strongly recommended for pre_route and post_route RC
extraction in process nodes of 32nm and lower, because of the increased accuracy that is
necessary at these nodes.

SUMMARY
In addition to the technology file, the capacitance table file is specified for all the RC corners. If the
technology file is already specified for all the RC corners, the capacitance table file is not required
for pre_route and post_route extraction. In a new session, the capacitance table files can be
removed from the create_rc_corner command to enable the technology file to be used for pre_route
and post_route (effort level medium/high/signoff) extraction engines.
DESCRIPTION
This warning message is displayed when the process node set using set_design_mode is greater
than 32nm and both technology and captable files are specified for all the RC corners. Using this
setup, the captable file would be used for pre_route extraction. However, to enable pre_route
extraction using the technology file, remove the captable file specification from create_rc_corner in
a new session. This would change the default value of the effort level for post_route extraction to
medium, and the low effort level would not be allowed.

SUMMARY
Row '%s' cannot accommodate all pad cells, needs %d sites > %d row sites. The create_floorplan
needs to be enlarged to place the pads legally in the IO rows.set_io_flow_flag 0 to disable the IO
row flow and avoid this message.
DESCRIPTION
If set_io_flow_flag is 1 when loading a design, a check is run to verify the IO rows can
accommodate the pads in the design. This warning indicates there are more pad cells than the IO
rows can accommodate so the create_floorplan needs to be enlarged. Run check_place to report
overlapping pads and look for pads placed outside the IO rows. If you want to avoid this message
disable the IO row flow by setting set_io_flow_flag 0 prior to loading the design.

SUMMARY
No IO rows in design. Use command "get_io_flow_flag" to get the current IO flow(with or without
row). To avoid this error message, Use command"set_io_flow_flag" to change the IO flow.
DESCRIPTION
Innovus issues above error message on restoring the saved design. Though, I have no IO cells
defined in my Verilog netlist and I am not reading in any IO cells in my libraries.Why does Innovus
issue this error message? init_design or read_def issues this error message if IO rows are not
defined in the design and below option is set to 1 in the globals file: set conf_use_io_row_flow 1
This variable is set to 1 for IO Row Flow in Innovus.

SUMMARY
Cell '%s' for IO '%s' has LEF/OA CLASS other than PAD or sub class AreaI0.
DESCRIPTION
If a customer is using OA libraries instead of LEF, they are confused by the wording of the ERROR
message. The message should automatically change to say OA instead of LEF if Innovus was
started with OA libraries. If this is not possible at this time, then the ERROR message should say
LEF/OA libraries and not just LEF.
Example:
Cell '%s' for IO '%s' has LEF CLASS other than PAD or sub class AreaI0.
or when starting Innovus with OA libraries:
Cell '%s' for IO '%s' has OA CLASS other than PAD or sub class AreaI0.
or

SUMMARY
IO cell '%s' doesn't overlap any IO row to snap to. When use IO row flow, tool will automatically
check that if IO pads and IO rows are matching. Recreate IO rows and then try to snap IO cell on the

DESCRIPTION
This warning message will be generated if you choose the IO row flow for pad placement
(set_io_flow_flag 1). When you use the IO row flow, tool will automatically check that if IO pads and
IO rows are matching. These messages just warn you that there is some mismatches in the IO row
flow.If you want to make the warning message disappear, please recreate IO rows and use
write_def then read_def to check. Else, you can ignore them or you can go with normal flow without
IO rows.set_io_flow_flag 0 #this will prompt to use the normal IO flow.Also, check for
"setUserDataValue conf_use_io_row_flow 1" in the .globals file. If the value of this variable is set to
1, then change this to 0 to avoid these warnings.

NAME
IMPFP-1871
SUMMARY
Failed to run the command because it attempts to change the top cell bounding box. Use the
'create_floorplan' command to modify top cell bounding box first before calling this command.
DESCRIPTION
When a user creates a floorplan let's say 100 by 100 and snapping to grid is enabled, the tool will
automatically snap the FP to the grid and the FP will end up to be 99.987 by 99.95. Next, when the
user wants to run a command like set_floorplan_rects (or several other command) with the original
Fplan coordinates, the toll will complain that this is an attempts to change the top cell bounding box.
This is true, because 100 is basically outside of the post-snapping bounding box (which is let's say
99.987). Either the user can turn off the auto-snap when creating the FP, do the operations he
wants, then use snap_floorplan to snap the FP to grid, or he must use the coordinates stored in the
DB after autosnap of the FP.

NAME
IMPFP-3101
SUMMARY
Skip don't touch net '%s'. When insert shifter for floating net & undriven net,the don't touch net
should be ignored.
DESCRIPTION
In the design there were many ports that had been assigned as set_dont_touch. These ports were
assigned to nets of the same name in the design. Based on the fact that these are dont_touch nets
in the design, Innovus System will not insert logic onto those nets, even if they are suggested as
necessary by the CPF for the design. With the SDC and CPF in conflict, Innovus System honors the
SDC that the net should not be changed and gave the above warning.
Example:
The user should confirm that the ports/nets labeled as dont_touch should indeed

March 2020 329 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
The above error is reported when restoring the design. Why is this error reported and how can I
avoid it?
This error indicates there are instances placed outside the design boundary.All instances with
placement status of placed, fixed or cover need to be placed within the design boundary. To resolve
this:
Place all cells currently placed outside the design boundary within the boundary. If these cells are
physical only cells (i.e. filler cells, decap cells,etc.) you can delete them from the database.
Example:
The following script can be used to delete and report all cells outside the
design boundary.

DESCRIPTION
Creates a routing blockage object that can be moved even outside the core area. The object area
prevents routing of specified metal layers, signal routes, and hierarchical instances in this area.
Currently only orthogonal edges are supported by this command. You must use DEF directly if you
need to create a blockage with 45-degree edges. Use this command during partition floorplanning.

 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
Example:
**WARN: (IMPFP-3803): Command "createObstruct" is obsolete and has been

create_place_blockage a??type soft {-box {x1 y1 x2 y2 } | -polygon {{x1 y1 } {x2
y2 }...} | -boxList {{llx1 lly1 urx1 ury1} {llx2 lly2 ...}}
However, this option allows not only all buffers and inverters but also
isolation cells and level shifters. If user wants to limit the size, type of
cells or even instances that are allowed in the area, one more command can be
used:
reset_selective_blockage_gate
[-help]
[-cells cellName ]
[-insts instName ]
In addition, other types of cells or instances can be allowed through the
following command:
set_selective_blockage_gate
[-help]
[-cells cellName ]
[-insts instName ]
This last 2 commands work when set_db place_detail_selective_blockage is set to true.

allow the ILM as non-empty module definitions during design import phase. Only empty module
definitions are supported. To fix this error, user can remove the module definitions in the top level
netlist to proceed. In other words modify the design data such that there is no non-empty ILM
module in the top netlist.

DESCRIPTION
This error message is seen while using ILMs in toplevel without flattening ILMs and any timing

eg., **ERROR: (IMPILM-380): Command 'createClockTreeSpec' is not supported in unflattened
state. Please use the 'flatten_ilm' command to put the design in flattened state, before calling this
command.
Here, the the user tried to execute the command "create_clock_tree_spec" before flattening the
ILMs. All super commands such as opt_design, time_design, ccopt_design etc., automatically take
care of flattening and upon completion, leave the design in an unflattened state.
All other timing/optimization commands require you to run flatten_ilm first so that the nets and
instances internal to ILM are exposed to the timing engine.

IMPILM-402
NAME
IMPILM-402
SUMMARY
Interactive constraint is allowed only in flattened state of design. Specified interactive constraint '%s'
would be lost.
DESCRIPTION
Why does Innovus System issue the above error message when I enter interactive constraints such
as set_timing_derate?
How can one avoid this error?
In general, for ILMs constraints are supported through create_constraint_mode /
update_constraint_mode specified in your mmmc setup. You may refer to our Foundation Flow
scripts for detailed information. If specified interactively, they could only be done so in flattened
mode and would be discarded in unflattened mode. However, the best way to specify your
constraints is upfront through the above MMMC constructs and binded to -ilm_sdc_file argument,
and they would thus be read automatically in the flow. If there are constraints that you need to
specify which could not be done in an SDC file (e.g. setTimingDerate, group_path), then you need
to provide them through set_ilm_non_sdc_constraint_file <fileName>.
You cannot specify the interactive constraints when ILMs are not flattened (unflatten_ilm).In the
flatten mode (flatten_ilm), you can specify both interactive and modeless constraints and these
constraints are used during various cycles of unflatten_ilm to flatten_ilm. During write_db, these
constraints are honored.
To specify additional constraints while running unflatten_ilm, set the following:
set_global timing_defer_mmmc_obj_updates true
set_interactive_constraint_modes [all_constraint_modes -active|or your_own_list_of_modes]
foreach mode {list_of_modes_to_be_updated} {update_constraint_modes -name $mode -

SUMMARY
'%s' is not supported in flattened ILM state. Internally Innovus will unflatten the ILMs in the design
and will flatten them back before exiting the command. To improve run time, unflatten_ilm command
should be called explicitly for a group of commands that do not work in flattened state.
DESCRIPTION
When ilm_keep_flatten option of set_db is set to true, for non-related timing commands Innovus will
automatically unflatten the design, run the command, and flatten the design back. However it may
take more run time if Innovus run unflatten_ilm/flatten_ilm for each non-related timing command. It is
recommended that the user explicitly runs unflatten_ilm for a group of commands that do not work in
flattened mode to improve run time.

At top-level design, verify the design after the design has been optimized

SUMMARY
There is no verilog netlist found in init_netlist_files. The variable is either not specified or specified

DESCRIPTION
This issue can be resolved as one of the following scenarios:
1. Check the location of Verilog file; if you had created soft links, it might have been deleted.
2. When restoring a design, an error might have occurred in sourcing the design.globals file, check
the log for this error:
This error indicates certain variables in the global file no longer exist or have been replaced with
newer ones; this error prevents the rest of the globals file from being read, and hence the Verilog
netlist cannot be accessed.
Update to a new EDI System version OR make sure you maintain a version consistency in saving
and restoring designs.

SUMMARY
The layer '%s' referenced %s is not found in the database. The obstruction geometries specified on
the layer are being ignored. A layer must be defined in the LEF technology LAYER section before it
can be referenced from a macro. Review the LEF files specified in the init_lef_files variable to see if
the layer does not exist or is specified after the one that defines the macro.
DESCRIPTION
This error reports that a macro OBS references a layer that has not been defined. The layer must be
defined before they can be referenced from a macro. The layer is either missing from the LEF files
that were read or it was defined in a LEF that was specified after the one that contained the macro.
Review the LEF files specified in the init_lef_files variable to see if the layer is defined and, if so,
reorder the LEF files in the init_lef_files variable so that the LEF file that contains the layer is read
before the one that contains the macro.

SUMMARY
%s is not an even number of manufacturing grids which will result in DRC errors. Check the
manufacturing grid definition in the technology LEF file and make sure the value is an even multiple
of the grid.
DESCRIPTION
When reading LEF Innovus System will check that WIDTH value on routing layer is an even
number of manufacturing grids defined in the technology LEF file (MANUFACTURINGGRID). This
will ensure that both the edge and the center-line of the wires will stay on the manufacturing grid.
Look for the following line in the LEF file to determine how many database units is 1 micron
(dbuPerMicron):
UNITS DATABASE MICRONS dbuPerMicron ;
To check if your dbu's have enough granularity, multiply dbuPerMicron * manufaturingGrid. The
result should be an integer quantity that is evenly divisible by two to ensure the center-line is on
grid.
For example, if MANUFACTURINGGRID is 0.005, this is only achievable with a DBU of 2000.
- (1000*0.005)/2 = 2.5, (not evenly divisible by two), the result could be off manufacturing grid.
- (2000*0.005)/2 = 5, (evenly divisible by two), the result will be on manufacturing grid.

Or to say it another way:
If dbuPerMicron * manufacturingGrid is an odd number (e.g. 1000*0.005 = 5), you cannot create a
path (center-line based) that has a width that is an odd number of manufacturing grids wide.

SUMMARY
Pin '%s' in macro '%s' has no ANTENNAGATEAREA value defined. The library data is incomplete
and some process antenna rules will not be checked correctly.
DESCRIPTION
This warning is triggered when the technology data has process antenna rules, and a signal pin is
missing process antenna data needed to check the rules. In this case, a signal pin that is either an
input or inout pin is missing the gate-area data.
In CMOS, every signal pin that is an input or inout pin connects to a transistor gate. If there is no
gate-area associated with this pin, then the library data is incomplete and process antenna rules
cannot be checked for this pin correctly. The router and verification commands will assume this pin
has no transistor gate attached, and therefore does not need to be protected from process antenna
violations, which may result in real violations that are not fixed by the router or seen by the
verification commands.
The best way to avoid this warning is to add the correct antenna gate-area data to the library data.
You can also use the suppressMessage command to turn off this warning message. This might be
appropriate if you know the only library cells without antenna data are already protected by internal
diode cells (e.g. some blocks might be built this way). In that case, you would lose the possible
benefit of those internal diode cells for any nets connected to the block input, which might cause the
router to add some unnecessary diode cells to protect other inputs attached to the same net. This is
somewhat dangerous, because you might suppress messages for pins that are not protected.
You can also turn off the warning if you believe antenna errors are rare for these pins in practice,
and you will depend on final sign-off physical verification tools to find any errors, and repair them

SUMMARY
Pin '%s' in macro '%s' has no ANTENNADIFFAREA value defined. The library data is incomplete
and some process antenna rules will not be checked correctly.
DESCRIPTION
This warning is triggered when the technology data has process antenna rules, and a signal pin is
missing process antenna data needed to check the rules. In this case, a signal pin that is either an
output or inout pin is missing the diffusion-area data.
In CMOS, every signal pin that is an output or inout pin connects to a transistor diffusion. If there is
no diffusion-area associated with this pin, then the library data is incomplete and process antenna
rules cannot be checked for this pin correctly. In that case, the router may try to protect other input
pins connected to the same net with extra routing and vias ('layer-hopping'), or add extra diode cells
to avoid 'false' antenna violations. The verification commands may flag false violations also.
The best way to avoid this warning is to add the correct antenna diffusion-area data to the library
data.
You can also use the suppressMessage command to turn off this warning message. This might be
appropriate if you know that antenna violations are rare in this technology, and you are willing to
tolerate some extra layer-hopping, or extra diode cells that are not really necessary.

DESCRIPTION
This error reports that a LEF via is defined with the same name as a LEF via that has been
previously defined and read into the database. The new definition is therefore ignored. The via
name can not be the same if the via geometry is different. Make sure different via definitions have
different via names. Otherwise, it may cause incorrect and undesired result. Review the LEF files to
ensure that you have not specified duplicate LEF files, or LEF files with duplicate VIA definitions.

DESCRIPTION
A new P/G port is added for a supply net to go into a module. This is most likely to connect new
buffers added by application.
This will cause inconsistency of physical netlist and power intent which defines all P/G connection

Do either of following steps will prevent new port being created during the design process.
For hierarchical power intent, user should define supply ports for all connecting nets of a scope, and
connect all of them
with connect_supply_net -ports.
To prevent a P/G net being used to connect into a scope, user should utilize extra_supplies option
to control P/G connection.

SUMMARY
OpenAccess (OA) shared library installation is older than the one that was used to build this %s
version. For using the OA installation built and tested with this %s version, unset the shell variable
OA_HOME. For using '%s' or higher version of OA, reset OA_HOME to point to that installation.
DESCRIPTION
These errors are only reported when you point to an OpenAccess (OA)
installation which is older than the tool version was built with. By default,
tool will use the OA version in the tool installation unless the environment
variable OA_HOME is set to point to another OA installation. To resolve this
issue, the recommendation is to use 'unsetenv OA_HOME' so tool will use the
local OA installation. Alternatively, set OA_HOME to a compatible OA
installation.
OA versions are signified using three sets of numbers separated by a period
(i.e. XX.YY.ZZZ) or sometimes the third number is separated with a dash (i.e.
XX.YY-ZZZ). OA versions are compatible if the first two sets of numbers are
the same.
To determine what OA version an IC610 or tool installation was compiled with by
going to http://downloads.cadence.com and clicking on the README or
README.OA file. This is listed next to each release.

SUMMARY
Found busBit terminals of bus '%s' of cell '%s' without bus ordering information in OpenAccess
library '%s'. There could be more such terminals without bus order information. This may lead to
problems during write_db. It is recommended to run verilogAnnotate on the library for annotating
bus ordering information to such terminals.
DESCRIPTION
The issue occurs because the bus ordering information for cell’s busBit terminals is not present.
The OpenAccess (OA) libraries were created using lef2oa. LEF file contains no information about
bus order of busBit terminals. When using this tool with OA, the bus ordering information must be
annotated into the abstract using the verilogAnnotate utility.
To run verilogAnnotate for the cell to update the existing OA data with
terminal ordering information from a Verilog file.

Why do I receive the error above when importing my design into tool?
This error indicates tool is unable to find an OpenAccess (OA) library.
For example, if your .globals file defines:
set init_oa_ref_libs {oaLib1 oaLib2}
But your cds.lib (or lib.defs) file only defines oaLib1:
DEFINE oaLib1 ./oaLib1
March 2020 434 Product Version 20.10

Correct this by removing the reference for oaLib2 or specifying the path to
oaLib2 in your cds.lib file:
DEFINE oaLib1 ./oaLib1
DEFINE oaLib2 ./oaLib2
Also, make sure you are not confusing the syntax for the cds.lib file and the
lib.defs file. We recommend using a cds.lib file. Its syntax is:
DEFINE libName libPath
If the error is preceded by the following warning then there is not a cds.lib

SUMMARY
Custom via definition for via '%s' cannot be created in the technology database, because the
technology database associated with library '%s' is readonly.
DESCRIPTION
In the tool's Flow new vias may be created during
power routing. These are typically via arrays created from VIARULE GENERATE
statements in the technology LEF. When saving the design to OpenAccess (write_db or
write_oa) via definitions of these vias need to be added to the technology library if they cannot
be defined in a parameterized form using standard vias from the OpenAccess technology file. To
see if the via is defined in parameterized form, use write_def to create a DEF
file and look for vias in the VIAS section that are defined using the + RECT
syntax instead of + VIARULE syntax.
If the vias cannot be represented by standard vias then a new custom via must be
created which requires writing to a technology file. Therefore, you must have
write permissions or allowed to do an incremental update of the technology
library.
March 2020 437 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
Since the technology database needs to be incrementally updated, the recommended method is to
create
local technology database in design library either using 'create_oa_lib -oa_reference_tech_libs' or
'set_db
-oa_lib_create_mode reference' option. For example:
create_oa_lib myLib -oa_reference_tech_libs myRefLib
set init_oa_design_lib myLib
Or
set_db -oa_lib_create_mode reference
Then define the place and route technology rules in myRefLib by importing a
technology LEF. This creates a local technology database in the design library
that can be modified incrementally. Overall, when setting up your mixed-signal
design environment we recommend using a Base PDK which contains the base
technology file and an incremental technology database (ITDB) which references the
Base PDK. The ITDB contains the information for physical design and can be
updated, while the Base PDK can remain read-only.

SUMMARY
Unable to find module terminal '%s' for module '%s' in '%s/%s/%s'. Connectivity cannot be
maintained if the terminal does not exist for module.
DESCRIPTION
One of the possible reason can be - If the design is re-mastered from abstract views that
were used by tool and layout views that can be used by verification tools,
the re-mastered view does not have any terminals. The write_oa -no_connectivity
option must be specified to be able to save the database. As the database will
not have connectivity information it will not be able to be reloaded if no
connectivity exists in the cellview that was written. A cellview created using
the -no_connectivity option is designed to be used with verification tools that
do not need the OpenAccess database to contain connectivity information.

SUMMARY
Cannot find definition of BUS Terminal '%s' of Cell '%s' in reference library. This could lead to
further errors while saving the OpenAccess (OA) database. Possible reasons could be that
verilogAnnotate was not run on the OA reference library that has the definition for this cell. Either
run verilogAnnotate on the reference library to fix this problem or use command 'set_db -
oa_allow_bit_connection true' before saving design to make bitwise connection of terminals.

write_db. The OA libraries were created using lef2oa.
When using tool with OA, the bus pin order must be annotated into
the abstract using the verilogAnnotate utility. This step is done after
importing the LEF macro data and prior to running write_db .
Failure to complete this step on macros with the bus pins causes tool to
display this warning message.
Example:
To prevent this warning, a Verilog stub file is needed for each macro with bus
pins. This might be derived from the symbol view using the 'Create-Cellview-From'
in Cellview menu command. Once you have a stub file for each macro which has bus
pins run verilogAnnotate at the Linux command line using the following steps:
$CDSHOME/share/oa/bin/verilogAnnotate \
-refLibs reference_library_name \
-verilog stub.v
where, stub.v contains the module definitions with only port list, input/output
direction and bus definitions of the referenced blocks.
Alternatively, you can set "set_db -oa_allow_bit_connection true" prior to
write_db in place of running verilogAnnotate.

library cell is found in multiple libraries, that is likely not intended and
the values variables should be updated to prevent the duplicate cell from being

SUMMARY
Pin '%s' in macro '%s' has no ANTENNAGATEAREA value defined. The library data is incomplete
and some process antenna rules will not be checked correctly.
DESCRIPTION
This warning is triggered when the technology data has process antenna rules,
and a signal pin is missing process antenna data needed to check the rules. In
this case, a signal pin that is either an input or inout pin is missing the
gate-area data.
In CMOS, every signal pin that is an input or inout pin connects to a
transistor gate. If there is no gate-area associated with this pin, then the
library data is incomplete and process antenna rules cannot be checked for this
pin correctly. The router and verification commands will assume this pin has no
transistor gate attached, and therefore does not need to be protected from
process antenna violations, which may result in real violations that are not
fixed by the router or seen by the verification commands.
The best way to avoid this warning is to add the correct antenna gate- area
data to the library data.

You can also use the set_message -suppress command to turn off this warning message.
This might be appropriate if you know the only library cells without antenna
data are already protected by internal diode cells (e.g. some blocks might be
built this way). In that case, you would lose the possible benefit of those
internal diode cells for any nets connected to the block input, which might
cause the router to add some unnecessary diode cells to protect other inputs
attached to the same net. This is somewhat dangerous, because you might
suppress messages for pins that are not protected.
You can also turn off the warning if you believe antenna errors are rare for
these pins in practice, and you will depend on final sign-off physical
verification tools to find any errors, and repair them manually.

{boundary pin_shapes}" that tells tool to read only the information specified,
and ignore any mismatches. So for
example, if you used -filter pin_shapes, any existing pin shapes would be
replaced by the ones read from the OA cellview. Please refer the documentation for more details.
If you are using a prior version of tool than 13.2 , the -filter option isn't available and
a workaround is required:
1)load the config file in tool.
2)save OA design

3)Load the design in Virtuoso Layout-XL
4)File->Load Physical View (Be sure to load the pins in "update" mode)
5)Save the new/updated design
6)Restore this design in tool and continue with the P&R flow.

DESCRIPTION
The issue occurs because the mentioned bit is not on the interface of the

Verilog modules. So, if a OpenAccess abstract terminal has isInterface = nil, that
means that it should not appear in the Verilog netlist when running write_netlist
unless the -include_pg_ports or -phys options are used. Terminals with
isInterface = nil should only be connected to a USE POWER/GROUND net, not a
regular signal net. Assuming that the Verilog module (and .lib) has port, then
running verilogAnnotate will set the bit on the abstract's terminal to true
instead of nil.

SUMMARY
Via definition for std via '%s' is not found in the OpenAccess (OA) technology database associated
with the design. Possible reason could be that this design has been read or created using a
different OA technology database or LEF and these two database are out of sync. This serious
issue should be fixed before proceeding further. To save the design, %s is creating custom via
definition in current OA technology database for the std via '%s'.
DESCRIPTION
If a VIA in the tool database is parameterized and refers to a LEF rule
VIARULE .. GENERATE, then write_oa will expect a matching (by name) oaStdViaDef to
use for the parameterized via. If the oaStdViaDef is not found, then a fixed
via (oaCustomViaDef) will be created instead which means that the parameterized
form is lost in the roundtrip (write_oa -> OpenAccess (OA) -> read_oa).
If the creation succeeds and the user doesn't need the Vias remain
parameterized, the message can be ignored.
If the user would want to have the Vias remain parameterized, they should
compare their "technology" data to see why the oaStdViaDef name does not match
the LEF VIARULE GENERATE name.

SUMMARY
pull_pin_constraint is unable to pull pin constraint from cell '%s' because it has no layout cellview
bound to it. If the cell is bound to abstract cellview, use option -cellview to specify the 'lib cell view'
name for pull_pin_constraint to find the target layout cellview.
DESCRIPTION
When any of the options (-cell, -inst or -all_blocks) is specified, this command pulls the pin
constraints from the layout cellview that is bound to the cell(s). This error is displayed when there is
no layout cellview bound to the cell itself. One possibility could be that the master cellview of the
cell is an abstract cell and tool can't find its corresponding layout cellview. In such case, by default,
tool expects the view name of the layout cellview to be 'layout' and its location to be under the same
library/cell directory as the abstract cellview. Use the option -cellview to specify the 'lib cell view'
name for pull_pin_constraint to find the target layout cellview.

DESCRIPTION
The technology information in the design library that the cellview is being
saved into must be the same as the original library technology that was used to
create the in session technology information.
You need to set this library as design library so that tool understands the
hierarchy library/cell/view.
To set the library as design library use following command
set init_oa_design_lib "test1"
After this setting, tool will not give the warning message (IMPOAX-1625) during

SUMMARY
WSPs can not be saved in OpenAccess database. We can not create purpose '%s' in technology,
because the technology database associated with library '%s' is readonly.
DESCRIPTION
Since the technology database needs to be incrementally updated, the recommended method is to
create
local technology database in design library either using 'create_oa_lib -oa_reference_tech_libs' or
'set_db
-oa_lib_create_mode reference' option. For example:

Error and Warning Messages
create_oa_lib myLib -oa_reference_tech_libs myRefLib
set init_oa_design_lib myLib
Or
set_db -oa_lib_create_mode reference
Then define the place and route technology rules in myRefLib by importing a
technology LEF. This creates a local technology database in the design library
that can be modified incrementally. Overall, when setting up your mixed-signal
design environment we recommend using a Base PDK which contains the base
technology file and an incremental technology database (ITDB) which references the
Base PDK. The ITDB contains the information for physical design and can be
updated, while the Base PDK can remain read-only.

DESCRIPTION
This error is caused by a missing LEFDefaultRouteSpec or not properly
referencing the library which defines the LEFDefaultRouteSpec. To debug this do
the following.
First, use Virtuoso to output an ascii version of the technology file from the
ITDB (techLoadDump -d gsclib090 output.ascii). It should contain a
LEFDefaultRouteSpec constraint group as shown below. This defines the rules for
physical design:
;( group [override] )
;( ----- ---------- )
( "LEFDefaultRouteSpec" nil
spacings(
( minWidth "Cont" 0.12 )

Also, verify it references the base technology file. For example, you can see
it references gpdk090 below:

SUMMARY

DESCRIPTION
You should check if the buffer(s)/inverter(s) are available in the timing libraries. If yes ensure
footprint and function of buffer(s)/inverter(s) are defined properly in the library. To make
March 2020 483 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
buffer(s)/inverter(s) usable:
- define buffer(s)/inverter(s) in libraries
- do not set buffer(s)/inverter(s) as dont_use, both in libraries and in constraint file(.sdc file)
You can use report_dont_use_cells command to reports cells that cannot be used for timing
optimization. This command also reports the source of the timing constraint: the timing library file,
timing constraint file, or the user (by specifying the set_opt_dont_use command).
In lower power designs verify the proper power domain binding has been done as following:
1. If your analysis views are defined in your CPF then commitCPF automatically creates delay
corners for each analysis view of the name analysis_view_dc. For example, "create_analysis_view
-name slow_PM01" will have a delay corner created named slow_PM01_dc. Innovus will
automatically create the viewDefinition.tcl according to the CPF and bind the libraries to the
respective delay corner and power domain.
2. If you have defined the MMMC definitions in a viewDefinition.tcl, you must define the complete
MMMC information in the viewDefinition.tcl, which means that each power domain has
"update_delay_corner -power_domain" to associate the delay corner to the power domains. There
is no need to define the view in CPF.
If CPF has the views, commitCPF will create the info which viewDefinition.tcl does not have.
Example:
In older releases you will get SOCOPT-600, SOCOPT-596, SOCOPT-3000 and
SOCOPT-3001 for ENCOPT-600, ENCOPT-596, ENCOPT-3000 and ENCOPT-3001 messages

Buffer insertion not successful. Reason: %s
DESCRIPTION
March 2020 484 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
The error is generated when buffer insertion is not successful.
Possible reasons are :
-The buffer insertion affects a net which cannot be optimized. You can run"report_ignored_nets -
out_file ignored.rpt" to get a list of nets which cannot be optimized because they are clock nets,
marked dont_touch, etc.
-The buffer insertion will change the port boundaries of a hierarchical instance which has
hierarchical port constraints set by "set_db opt_keep_ports keepPortHinstFile". You can run
"getOptMode -keepPort#get_db opt_keep_ports" to see the setting.
-The default location for the added buffer is not compatible with the driver power domain. If you want
to specify the location manually, you can use the -location option.
-There may be an existing MSV violation on the net (the driver PD is incompatible with the sink PD).
Maybe you want to insert an always on buffer,you can try and insert it with setting "set_db
opt_add_always_on_feed_through_buffers true".

 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
DESCRIPTION
This warning message is issued when the user tries to run opt_design command without specifying
the design stage, meaning preCTS, postCTS or postRoute.
Example:
This message can be avoided by running opt_design with correct options depending upon on the
stage of the design. As an example if the clock tree is not placed in the design then 'opt_design -
pre_cts' can be run to optimize the design for the set-up.

SUMMARY
The -hold option is not available with -pre_cts.
DESCRIPTION
This warning message is issued when the user tries to run -pre_cts optimization in hold mode and
the command exits without running pre_cts optimization. The '-hold' option cannot be specified with
pre_cts optimization.
In order to avoid this warning message '-hold' option should be removed while running pre_cts
optimization meaning only setup optimization makes sense at pre_cts stage.

SUMMARY
Option "-extractionEngine" for command setSIMode is obsolete. This option has been mapped to
the following option based on your selection of extraction engine for use in SI flow: %s Modify your
script to use the above setting instead of setSIMode -extractionEngine.
DESCRIPTION
How do I control which extractor is used to generate spef file?
It seems the behavior of set_db extract_rc_engine and extract_rc_effort_level have changed
indicated by the warnings above. Using set_db options extract_rc_engine and
extract_rc_effort_level to control which extractor is used by extract_rc is described below.
The extract_rc_engine option indicates whether to use the preRoute or postRoute extraction
engine. The extract_rc_engine values default, detail and CCE are now obsolete.
Use extract_rc_engine preRoute when the design has not been detail routed by NanoRoute yet.
This is equivalent to extract_rc_enginee default in previous versions of Innovus. When
extract_rc_engine preRoute is set RC extraction is done by the fast density measurements of the
surrounding wires; coupling is not reported.
Use extract_rc_engine postRoute after the design has been detail routed by NanoRoute.RC
extraction is done by the detailed measurement of the distance to the surrounding wires; coupling is
reported. The effortLevel parameter further specifies which postRoute engine is used for balancing

performance versus accuracy needs.
The extract_rc_effort_level value controls which extractor is used when the postRoute engine is
used.
low - Invokes the native detailed extraction engine. This is the same as specifying the
extract_rc_engine postRoute setting.
medium - Invokes the Turbo QRC (TQRC) extraction mode. TQRC performance and accuracy falls
between native detailed extraction and IQRC engine. This engine supports distributed processing.
TQRC engine is recommended for process nodes < 65nm. Note: This setting does not require a
QRC license.
high - Invokes the Integrated QRC (IQRC) extraction engine. IQRC provides superior accuracy
compared to TQRC. IQRC is recommended for extraction after ECO. In addition, IQRC supports
distributed processing.Note: IQRC requires a QRC license.
signoff - Invokes the Standalone QRC extraction engine. This engine choice provides the highest
accuracy. The engine has several runModes, thereby,providing maximum flexibility.
The default value depends on the value of setDesignMode. The default for nodes above 65nm is
low. TQRC (effortLevel medium) is the default extraction engine in the postroute flow for 65 nm and
below design. However, TQRC and IQRC do not support the obsoleted 3 corner flow
(defineRCCorner flow) and require a QRCTechfile. Therefore, Native Detailed (effortLevel low)
engine remains the default engine if no QRCTechfile has been defined or if the defineRCCorner
command has been used.
Should you use Turbo QRC (tQRC) or standalone QRC?
The extraction time with tQRC is typically a small percentage of the total flow time. With standalone
QRC, the runtime would be longer.
Standalone QRC requires the usage of a QRC license (tQRC uses the Innovus license). It writes
out a DEF and invokes the standalone tool. It is slower than tQRC. It is not incremental like tQRC,
so the runtime impact may be high. tQRC is incremental and if changes are small, extraction
runtime drops to almost zero. The delta between standalone QRC and tQRC in terms of accuracy is
typically small, so there is usually no flow advantage or end QoR gain by doing it.
Cadence's suggestion is to use TurboQRC for 65nm and below nodes in the postRoute flow, and
for signoff use standalone QRC.
Note: setSIMode -extractionEngine is obsolete and extraction during SI fixing will use the values of
set_db extract_rc_engine and extract_rc_effort_level to determine the extractor to use.

DESCRIPTION
This warning is seen if the initial innovus db itself has batch mode enabled or the user has set it
intentionally. Multiple ECO changes can be done in batch mode. This takes lesser run time when
compared to batch mode false. Once all the ECOs are done, we must exit batch mode, because
optimization and many other commands do not work properly in batch mode. Timing updates for all
ECOs done inside batch mode are done at once when batch mode is exited.
Example:
set_db eco_batch_mode true
eco_add_repeater/eco_delete_repeater/eco_update_cell ...; # No timing update is done during
these ECOs.
set_db eco_batch_mode false; # This would update timing incrementally for all the above ECOs at
once.

ANTENNAGATE, ANTENNADIFF etc... swapping is not allowed for such instances. For more
information use the new report_lef_equivalent_cells command. It requires the name of a LEF cell to
check, and optionally an output file for the results:
report_lef_equivalent_cells -lib_cell <lib_cell> -out_file <out_file>
During normal timing optimization, opt_design will resize instances as required.Cells of different
sizes but the same function are not equivalent, because you cannot safely swap one for the other
without risk of overlap or other DRV.Commands like opt_leakage_power, or timing optimization on
fixed instances, will attempt what is known as "lefsafe" swapping, where you replace one cell with
another of the same size, pin geometry, antenna gate area, etc. You can do this postRoute without
risk of overlaps or need to re-legalize the placement.If two cells have the same function and size but
are not lefsafe,report_lef_equivalent_cells will explain why.

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus could not find a path for net '%s' to reach '%s'. If the -topoFile option is
being used, the topology specified for this net is incomplete.
DESCRIPTION
In case automatic feedthrough insertion is being done, it means that a path to some of the terminals
could not be found. If the routeBased option is used, the routing may be incomplete. For the case
the topology file is used an explanation follows.
Tool issues above warning during add_partition_feedthrus command step, when topology file
provided with -topoFile is used to guide the tool for creating the feedthrough in a specified partition
for multi-fanout nets. You will get above warning if the topology file did not define for all the
terminals for a multi-fanout net. Always follow the convention from_pin to to_pin for writing the
topology file.
Example:
If the net goes to three partition A, B and C and you want to make a part of the net from A to D then

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus is trying to find a feedthrough path for net %s. It could not find a path to
partition or terminal [%s]. Partitions connected to this net may not be adjacent to each other.
DESCRIPTION
Automatic feedthrough insertion derives the feedthrough topology using the placement. It assumes
a channel-less design. The possibility of routing through channels is considered minimal. In this
design a path to a partition or terminal connected to the above mentioned net could not be found
without avoiding the channels.

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus skipping net [%s] because a path to some of the partitions or terminals
could not be found. It might not be necessary to insert feedthrough buffers for this net. If you wish to
insert feedthrough buffers for this net, then use the topology file for guided feedthrough buffer
insertion or use the -routeBased option after routing the net.
DESCRIPTION
add_partition_feedthrus assumes the design to be channel-less and partitions to be in the line of
sight for feedthrough path to pass from one partition to another. In case of channel based designs
where this is not true, the named net is ignored. In case feedthrough insertion is required for the net,
either route the design and used add_partition_feedthrus -routeBased or define the path for the net
in a topology file and use add_partition_feedthrus -topoFile <filename>

SUMMARY
The add_partition_feedthrus command was invoked with the -routeBased option, but the design
has not yet been routed. The add_partition_feedthrus command will skip the nets that are not
routed. Route the design using route_early_global for these nets to be considered for feedthrough
insertion.
DESCRIPTION
The add_partition_feedthrus command invoked with the -routeBased option requires routing for the
net to find a path based on which it will insert the feedthrough ports.
The net reported is not routed so it gets ignored. Route the design prior to running this command.

DESCRIPTION
This warning message is issued while assigning pins on a partition using the Innovus GUI with
Partition => Assign Pin... or when using the assign_partition_pins Tcl command.
The create_floorplan likely contains a problem with routing tracks and/or pin layer definitions. The
problem can be debugged graphically using: Partition => Specify Partition
Select the offending partition and review the Partition Pin Layer Used section. Make sure the layers
defined for pins are included in the Layers Reserved For Partition. Corrections may be made and
applied with this form. Check the min max layer allowed though get_db another reason could be
presence of route blockage or PG on partition edge blocking the routing tracks.
Next, confirm there are preferred routing tracks defined for the pin layers using the Layer Control =>
Track => Pref Track and the Wire&Via layer defined for the pins. If the tracks are incorrect, they may
be regenerated using the "generateTracks" Tcl command.
Example:
get_pin_constraint -cell c -side all -layer

SUMMARY
Pin [%s] of %s [%s] connected to net [%s] is [%s] at location (%8.3f, %8.3f) on layer %1d %s.
DESCRIPTION
Message reports specific error/violation on a partition pin.
Example of ABUTMENT violation on a pin:
---------------------------------------
Pin [pin_1] of partition [ptn_1] connected to net [net_1] is [PLACED] at location (210.452, 540.160)
on layer 8 has ABUTMENT violation WITH partition chip.
In above example error/violation is being reported for partition “ptn_1” pin's “pin_1” which is
connected to net “net_1” and is placed at location “210.452, 540.160” on layer “8” having
assignment status as “placed”. Pin has abutment (is placed on adjoining boundary of “ptn_1” and
“chip”) violation with partition named “chip”. Ideally the pin pair of two adjoining (abutting) partitions
should be placed on same track on edge of partition boundaries, touching each other (abutting).
Abutment violation could be because of following two reasons:
1. Net has multi-partition-pins. Since all other pins of different partitions cannot be placed at same
location (no electrical connection through any overlap of physical shape), so it is reported as
abutment violation.
2. “pin_1” pin of net “net_1” is not connected to any pin of adjoining (abutted) partition “chip”.

above net is connected to a partition PG port when connecting to an instance PG term inside the
partition, and run the command again.
DESCRIPTION
Reason of such incorrect PG net connection is generally introduced by either incorrect UPF or
incorrect GNC rule. To correct this error, ensure that the above net is connected to a partition PG
port when connecting to an instance PG term inside partition. Or, if this connection is not needed
inside the partition hinst, then ensure that the net does not connect to any of the PG terms inside the

that enclosure rules are not defined on the layer and/or for the cut class, so the cut enclosure values

SUMMARY
Command 'add_route_via_defs' is normally used for debugging and testing. The vias are only
generated in this Innovus session, and will not be kept during write/read for nanoroute to use the
next time. Use 'set_db add_route_vias_auto true' before 'init_design' or 'read_db' if you want
generated vias to be used by nanoroute in later Innovus sessions.
DESCRIPTION
Command 'add_route_via_defs' can generate all the vias for signal routing automatically, including
single cut vias, double cut vias, MAR vias, and even DFM vias. It is used in the Innovus flow, to help
insure good routing results. Users don't need to manually create vias to meet the complex rules in
advanced technology, 'genereateVias' will consider the rules (including non-default rules) and
create the vias needed for routing. Since the vias are only generated in current Innovus session,
and will not be kept during write/read for NanoRoute to use the next time, this command is only
used for debugging and testing. The standard usage flow is to set 'set_db add_route_vias_auto
true' before 'init_design' or 'read_db'. It will call 'add_route_via_defs' whenever the design is
initialized or restored in innovus. This mode option setting can be saved in database by write_db.
You can get more information about 'set_db' by 'man set_db'.

SUMMARY
Unable to trace scan chain "%s". Check the information during tracing.
DESCRIPTION
Possible reason for scan trace failure is that instance in the scan chain has multiple corresponding
pins for scan tracing.
How to solve the problem:
1. Use a Scan DEF file to define the exact instance pins trace_scan should trace through. Most
modern synthesis tools can export a Scan DEF file which can then be imported into Innovus
System using the read_def command:
read_def scanchain.def
2. If the design contains bidirectional pads, try defining the start/stop points of the scan chain on the
core side of the pad so the tracer does not have to trace through the pad.
3. If instances in the scan chain has complex logic, set "set_db reorder_scan_comp_logic true"
before trace_scan.

 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
Instance's output pin "%s/%s" (Cell "%s") has no corresponding input pin for scan tracing.
DESCRIPTION
After reading scandef file, Innovus system gives the message during trace_scan. The warning
message here is due to fact that scandef file and the verilog netlist are not compatible with respect
to the scan chain and so tool is not able to trace it.
Example:
---------
**WARN: (ENCSC-1022): Instance's output pin "i_Scan/i_Core/i_inst/QN" (Cell "XXX") has no
corresponding input pin for scan tracing.
The relevant part in the scandef file is like below:
============
+ ORDERED
i_Scan/i_Core/i_inst ( IN SI ) ( OUT Q ) ---> It should be QN here.
i_digitalScan/i_digitalCore/U9714 ( IN B1 ) ( OUT ZN )
============
The output "QN" is reported by the tool for not having corresponding input pin for scan tracing
because the scan chain is defined over the pin "Q" in scandef file.
The scan chain is defined at negated output QN of the Flop but scan def file points to pin Q of the
flop (which is not the part of scan chain) and hence tool is not able to trace it. So, make sure that
scandef file and the verilog netlist are compatible with respect to the scan chain for the tool to trace
it successfully.

corrected to match the netlist.
DESCRIPTION
This message is generated when the original SCAN DEF does not match the design netlist. One
possible reason this may happen is because of an ECO operation which adds a buffer to a scan
chain for hold fixing.
Example
--------
Sample SCAN DEF (excerpt) :

DESCRIPTION
When doing Cell-to-Preroute design rule checks, the cell PR boundary is
used as the search area, and as bounding box for insertion into search trees.
Thus, spacing checks from a special wire geometry may see the PR boundary
to be ok as a pre-check, and may not do detailed checking on each pin in
this situation.
Thus, in this corner case, the pin outside the PR boundary may be causing a
spacing violation, but will not be detected.
This is library cell modeling issue, and can not be fixed at design stage.

defined with only symmetry Y, and must not have
symmetry X - allowing cells to be flipped around Y axis (R0->MY), but not X axis (R0->MX).
This message is reported when a core site definition includes the symmetry X which is typically not
intended. SYMMETRY X means the site is symmetric about
the x axis. This means that N and FS sites are equivalent, and FN and S site are equivalent. A
macro with an orientation of N matches N or FS rows.
Typically, this is not intended because it would allow the power rails to not align (i.e. the cell would
be allowed to flip so a VDD rail aligns with a VSS
rail). Typically, only time X symmetry might be used for a site is with double height cells.
This message simply is indicating that Innovus does not believe the X symmetry was intended and
therefore ignoring it. To avoid this message remove
the X symmetry from the site.
For more information on defining symmetry, please refer to the "LEF language reference" manual.

SUMMARY
Design has inst(s) with SITE '%s', but the floorplan has no rows defined for this site. Any locations
found for such insts will be illegal; create rows for this site to avoid this.
DESCRIPTION
This warning will be reported by commands such as check_floorplan and place_design
when the floorplan does not contain any rows for the specified site. Each
standard cell in the LEF should have a SITE defined for it. Instances of this
cell can only be placed in rows defined for this site.
Example:

Run the following command(replace RAM_site with your specific site name) to report the instances
which use this site:
.in +2
dbGet [dbGet -p3 top.insts.cell.site.name RAM_site].name
.in
When you create the initial floorplan, it should automatically create rows for
the standard cells defined in the netlist. You can add additional rows using
Floorplan - Row - Create Core Row or using the create_row text command. If this
warning is occurring on standard cells you must define rows for them or else
they will not be placed.
If this problem occurs for hard macros such as memories you can ignore it.
Rows are not required by the hard macros. Remove the SITE definition in the LEF for the
hard macros to avoid this message for them.
If this occurs for IO pads you can also ignore it. Rows for IO pads are
optional. You can create IO rows using Floorplan - Row - Create I/O Row or

DESCRIPTION
A floorplan object's basic site is usually the smallest site of all instances to be placed within that
object.
Here, a floorplan object can be a power-domain, a partition, or the entire core of a top-level or block
design.
There should be at least one row of the basic site in a given floorplan object; while other rows can
be of sites whose dimensions are integer multiples of those of its basic site.
In this case, the floorplan object has no rows of its basic site. Thus, instances of the cells using the
basic site will find no legal location within the confines of this floorplan object.

The selective property of soft-blockages is now default true. If the design was saved by any version
earlier then EDI14.1, then Innovus's behavior regards to soft blockage was different at the time

March 2020 630 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
DESCRIPTION
Possible reasons for no legal location found, are:
1. Width of instance's cell is too large for the dense power stripes'
pitch. Make sure that stripe's layer is not being treated as obstruction. Place-mode's -
setPrerouteAsObs setting may need a change.
2. Floorplan rows are created incorrectly, making rows for this instance's cell not be placeable.
Check correct basic site is set in floorplan creation.
3. Power/Ground followpin pre-routes do not match rows' orientations. Either re-create the rows, or
re-route followpin wires.
This will cause run-time issues during detail placement step called by place_design or refinePlace.
Example:
--------
This issue can be seen when there is a problem with globalNetConnects. If the power/ground pins
are not properly connected to the rail, then the rail appears as obstruction and the cells cannot be
legalized. The issue can be fixed by having proper orientation of rows in the floor-plan and by
[having] or re-routing follow pin wires matching row orientation.
For example, M2 followpin width is too large which causes spacing violations with M2 pins/obs of
certain cells no matter where these cells are placed. This causes long runtimes during legalization
and the resulting placement will not be illegal.
In order to debug this turn off DRC checking during place_design or detail_place using
.in +5
setPlaceMode -checkCellDRCFromPreRoute false.
.in
Once design is placed, turn DRC checking back-on and run check_place. Look for DRC violations
on these cells between M2 pins/obs and follow pin. Correct the follow pin routing to make sure the
DRC violations are gone between cells and follow pin. Rerun place_design/refinePlace again for
legalized placement.
Check for verifyGeometry for Std. cell check and make sure your Std. cell is in Sync. with Tech file,
to avoid legalization issues.

* There may be a conflict between cell-library and power-planning structure such that some cells
always have a spacing violation between thier pin or obs geometry and power net wires/vias/cuts.
* Some Region/Fence constraint may be over subscribed (IMPSP-452)

DESCRIPTION
Flat physical instances means that in the design hierarchy, they will

As fences/power-domains/partitions all are set on a module at a lower-
level then the top-of-the-design, the fillers will physically be
placed inside the bounding-box, but in DB, they will not belong
to the module associated with that placement-constraint. While
legalizing these physical instances, detail_place will see
these instances as not having the fence membership, and will throw
them out to the top-level.

The design must be completely placed before adding filler cell(s).
DESCRIPTION
When running add_fillers the warnings or error above are issued.
When add_fillers runs it checks whether the entire design is placed or not. If it
is not, you will see this messages. When user would like to work on floorplan
and want to run DRC checks on it in PVS or other tool, you may like to fill all
the entire row area with fillers instead of running an entire placement.
If user receive the IMPSP-5101 warning it will still fill the rows with filler
cells. It is simply warning you that the design is not entirely placed with
below warnings.
**WARN: (IMPSP-5102): There 'are' 10 unplaced instances in the design..

DESCRIPTION
While running restoreRoute or restoreDesign, the above message is issued when the connectivity
of a net recorded in the routing file of the EDI System database (*.route or *.route.gz file) does not
match the connectivity of the net in memory (usually read from the Verilog during init_design or
restoreDesign). Make sure the routing file correlates to the database in memory. If it does, try
running the latest software release of EDI as this may be due to a software issue. If the error still is
reported, please open a Case through http://support.cadence.com.
Overall, make sure you did not make any changes to the Verilog which are not reflected in the other
database files. If you need to modify the Verilog file, you should then run one of the ECO Flows
described in the EDI System User Guide.

SUMMARY
Instance %s added but could not find spare cell for it.
DESCRIPTION
Possible reasons for not finding a spare cell are:
1. Either the spare instance or the unplaced instance or both have region/fence placement
constraints and no spare instance could be found that does not cause a
constraint violation. To fix - remove the placement constraints on the spare
instances or add new spare instances into the same region/fence hierarchy
as the unplaced instances.
2. Spare instance having the same cell type as the unplaced instance is not available.
Check if set_spare_insts command has been used to specify the spare instances.
create_spare_module/place_spare_modules, read_spare_insts are some of the commands that
could
also be used to insert spare instances in the design.
3. eco_remap and eco_swap_spare_cell commands could be used to map any remaining unplaced
instances
after ecoPlace -useSpareCells to spare instances of different cell types.

Ignoring the -syncRelativePath setting in the configuration file. The -syncRelativePath parameter of
the set_import_mode command is set to true in ETS by default. All relative paths in the
configuration file will be synchronized to the current working directory. To avoid this warning,
remove the syncRelativePath setting from the configuration file.
DESCRIPTION
{This warning is displayed because the ETS software ignores the -syncRelativePath setting in the
configuration file and uses the default value (true) for the -syncRelativePath parameter of the
set_import_mode command. When the -syncRelativePath parameter of the set_import_mode
command is set to true, all the relative paths in the configuration file are synchronized to the current
working directory. As a result, the configuration file can be loaded from any directory without
changing the current working directory to the directory in which the configuration file was saved.
You can use the set_import_mode -syncRelativePath false command in ETS if you do not want to
synchronize the relative paths in the configuration file to the current working directory. Use this
command after invoking ETS and before reading the design. To avoid this warning, remove the -
syncRelativePath setting in the configuration file.}

SUMMARY
There are %d unplaced instances that will not be routed. Place all instances in the design before
routing. TrialRoute will continue.
DESCRIPTION
This message pops-up while running &'route_trial&' command if the design has any un-placed
instances. The design will still be routed issuing this warning message.
Example:
In order to fix this warning message user needs to check if there are any unplaced instances in the
design prior to running route_trial command. The unplaced instances can be reported by running
&'checkPlace checkPlace.rpt&' and verifying checkPlace.rpt file to find out unplaced instances and
fixing this issue.

SUMMARY
There are %d nets connecting a pad term to a fterm without geometry and these nets will not be
routed. A pad term is a pin of a pad logically connected to a top level module port (fterm). Type 'set
trPrintIgnoredPadNets <limit>' prior to route_trial to have it report each net up to <limit>. Review the
list of nets and verify they do not require a physical route between the pad pin and fterm. Top level

 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
fterms connecting to pad pins typically do not require a physical route because the pad pin will
connect to signals external to the design.
DESCRIPTION
This is referring to the top level ports that connect to the PAD pin of the IO pad. Since these signals
connect outside of the chip there is no port geometry to route to. For IO pins directly connected to IO
pads, Innovus System implicitly considers the pin of the IO pad as an IO pin. Typically, you can
ignore this warning.
Use &'set trPrintIgnoredPadNets <limit>&' prior to route_trial to report each net up to <limit>.
Review the list of nets and verify they do not require a physical route between the pad pin and fterm.
Top level fterms connecting to pad pins typically do not require a physical route because the pad
pin will connect to signals external to the design.
Example:
You can set the following to have the warning list the nets it is ignoring:
\tset trPrintIgnoredPadNets 100
It will print up to 100 nets as:
PAD NET <net> is ignored.
Note:
The ignored net info can only be seen in innovus.logv file and not in the innovus.log file.

SUMMARY
Min timing libraries are not specified, while max timing libraries are specified in configuration file.
This may cause issues in hold analysis. Use rda_Input(ui_timelib) instead of
rda_Input(ui_timelib,max) for timing library specification, or use setTimingLibrary command to set
min timing libraries. By default max timing libraries will be used for hold analysis.
DESCRIPTION
For a non-MMMC setup it is mandatory to provide both min and max libraries. During timing
analysis the max libraries are used during setup/late analysis and min libraries are used during
early/hold analysis. When the min libraries are missing, the software will only use the max libraries
for early/hold analysis, this may cause inaccurate timing results. It is, therefore, recommended that
you provide both max and min libraries in the configuration file.

SUMMARY
%s %s is partially routed in non-ECO mode and may be re-routed. If exiting wires are to be
preserved, set the route_design_with_eco option to true.
DESCRIPTION
This warning indicates a net is only partially routed and that if you want to preserve the pre-routed
segments you should set "set_db route_design_with_eco true". Otherwise, NanoRoute is free to re-
route the net entirely based on the best solution it finds for the net. If you do not mind the net being
re-routed you can ignore this warning.

SUMMARY
Missing via from %s %s to %s %s in %s %s. Add the missing via or remove all vias from %s %s so
that NR can use the vias from the default %s.
DESCRIPTION
In an NonDefaultRule, it is optional to specify which vias the rule should use during routing. If no
vias are defined then router will use the DEFAULT via's for the NonDefaultRule routing.
If NonDefaultRule has vias defined between some layers but not all, then this error is reported.
For example, if NonDefaultRule has vias defined between Metal1 and Metal2 but not between
Metal2 and Metal3, this error is reported, you need to define or specify vias between each layer.
See the NONDEFAULTRULE LEF syntax for more details on defining or specifying the vias to use.

DESCRIPTION
NanoRoute does not support setting the rule of a net if the net has already been partially or fully
routed. To set any attribute on a net, the prerouted wires must be deleted or converted to special
wires.
For example:

Error and Warning Messages
DESCRIPTION
Cannot find special net default for attribute -shield_net To reset an attribute to its default value
specify the value "default" with some exceptions (see below).
For example:
\tset_route_attributes -nets netName -route_rule default
\tset_route_attributes -net netName -preferred_extra_space default
Exceptions:
1. The option -shield_net has a default of "none" which may cause confusion. So for -shield_net
you must specify "none" to return it to its default value:
\tset_route_attributes -net netName -shield_net none
2. You have a net with -top_preferred_routing_layer set to 7 and -bottom_preferred_routing_layer
set to 6. You cannot reset -top_preferred_routing_layer first because its default value is 1 and the
top preferred layer is not allowed to be less than or equal to the bottom preferred layer. You need to
reset the bottom preferred layer first.
3. You cannot reset the non-default rule (NDR) on a routed wire. You must first delete the routing for
the wire then re-route it after changing its rule.

SUMMARY
Found non-default rules %s and %s in %s %s. Currently, only one default rule is supported on a net.
Correct this configuration to ontinue .
DESCRIPTION
Non-default rule (NDR) is applied to nets using set_route_attributes -nets netName -route_rule
<ruleName>. You cannot have multiple non-default rule on a single net which need to be routed.
A non-default rule can be modified on a net using update_route_rule as long as the net is not
routed. An error is reported if you try to modify a NONDEFAULTRULE of a routed net.
For example,
In order to change the non-default rule of a routed net you must delete the routing of the net, change
the rule, then re-route the net.
Ex :
delete_routes -net netName
set_route_attributes -nets netName -route_rule newRule
set_db route_design_selected_net_only true
select_net netName
route_design
If you have partially prerouted portions of the net, these sections must be defined as special nets.
Use the command convert_routes_to_special to convert these prerouted portions to special nets:
convert_routes_to_special -nets netName
One exception to the above is if a net is already routed, you can use edit_update_route_rule to
change the non-default rule applied to the wire segments of the net. edit_update_route_rule does
not change the non-default rule attribute of the net, so if the net is re-routed or ECO routed, it will be
routed with the widths and spacings of the original non-default rule applied to it.

DESCRIPTION
March 2020 730 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
Each net has a set of flags to indicate its statuses. One of them is a flag to indicate if a net is fully
routed. If this flag says a net is fully routed, but NanoRoute traverses every pin in the net and finds
some pin is not connected to the net, this warning will be issued.
This issue could happen when a tie-net pin is tied to the special net by special vias/wires. The flag
is set based on regular routing information, and it is possible that the pin does not exist in the
regular routing information imported from reference DB. NanoRoute is aware of this mismatch
issue, and performs a integrity check to detect it.
To fix the issue, check the warning pin if it is covered by STRIPE metal and connected by special
vias. You can delete the special vias and set option setAddStripeMode to skip dropping via on this
type of pins. Please reference command manual of setAddStripeMode and add_stripes. The
severity of this warning is not high.

SUMMARY
Connectivity is broken at PIN %s of INST %s connects to NET %s at location %s on LAYER %s.
The location is not inside the pin geometry extraction.
DESCRIPTION
This could be due to moved wires or cells from design optimization.
If the user edited wires or if opt_design move cells the connectivity may be broken and need re-
routing.
NanoRoute is capable of removing the problematic wires and reroute the PIN correctly.
If the wires are FIXED, you need to unfix them manually before routing.

SUMMARY
%s %s in %s %s does not have antenna diff area.
DESCRIPTION
This warning is reported when antenna fixing is enabled (set_db route_design_detail_fix_antenna
true) and an output or bi-directional pin is missing a value for AntennaDiffArea in the LEF.
AntennaDiffArea defines the diffusion area for this pin. This value is then used when calculating the
Process Antenna Effects (PAE) on the net connected to this pin. AntennaDiffArea defines the
diffusion area connected to a net. Diffusion discharges a net and lessens the process antenna
effect. If AntennaDiffArea is not defined then NanoRoute may perform unnecessary antenna fixing
using layer hopping and diode insertion which would not be needed if AntennaDiffArea was
properly defined for the pin.
If AntennaGateArea is not defined for input pins in LEF then it shows the warning for antenna gate
area.
In a summary if you simply want to stop this warning you can add ANTENNAGATEAREA 0; to the
input pin. While 0 is the default value if no statement is given, there is a difference between default,
and "the gate area is really 0". Same as for output pin. Put ANTENNADIFFAREA 0 ; for LEF output
pins without any diff area. In case of inout pin you have to add both ANTENNAGATEAREA and
ANTENNADIFFAREA to 0.

SUMMARY
%s %s in %s %s does not have physical port.
DESCRIPTION
This warning indicates this pin does not have a physical shape defined properly in the LEF for
MACRO or PAD cells.
The possible causes are:
- The pin does not have a RECT or POLY statement in the LEF to define its geometry.
- Another reason is the pin may be defined as USE POWER or GROUND. NanoRoute does not
route power pins.
For example:
MACRO INVXL
...
PIN A
DIRECTION INPUT ;
USE POWER ;
PORT
LAYER metal6 ;
RECT 104.000 1549.940 104.800 1553.420 ; # Physical definition of pin END END A If a pin
defined as a power or ground pin, and has SHAPE ABUTMENT or FEEDTHRU defined for it, then
NanoRoute will treat the pin as a physical obstruction. If the power/ground pin is missing the
SHAPE attribute then NanoRoute treats it as a logical pin and will report these warnings.

SUMMARY
Found shorts between two different ports on pin %s of cell_view %s. Loop detection and weak
connectivity checking will be skipped for this pin. If loop is not an issue, you can disregard this
message. Otherwise, pin geometries need to be corrected.
DESCRIPTION
This warning is issued when the geometries defined in separate PORT statements for a PIN in the
LEF short together or create a loop.
When a PIN has multiple PORT statements it means the geometries within each PORT statement
are weakly connected. So they typically should not overlap or touch. If they touch they are
considered strongly connected and should be within the same PORT statement.
NanoRoute runs special checks to avoid loops. When it encounters geometries in different PORT
statements which short together, it will disable this loop checking for this pin and issue the warning
above. You should review the PIN definition in the LEF and correct it as needed.
For example the pin below has 4 PORT statements which create a loop:
PIN A
DIRECTION INPUT ;
PORT
LAYER Metal1 ;
RECT 0 0 10 1 ;
END

RECT 0 0 1 10 ;

DESCRIPTION
A dangling wire has one or more endpoints that are not connected to pins or other wires.
NanoRoute will check if there are any dangling wires that are not FIXED in the net if a net has been
touched.
Common scenarios that introduce the dangling wires are:
\t1) Some instances are IPOed, but wires are marked FIXED
\t2) The nets are eco-routed, and some of the FIXED wires become dangling
\t3) Some wires status are changed and the design rerouted .
Note The wires in the frozen layers will not be deleted since the layers are locked.

It's important you have at least one via definition whose bottom metal layer meets the minimum area
rule. Otherwise, NanoRoute cannot meet the minimum area rule when stacking vias. For example:
#The M2 rectangle for the following via is not large enough to meet the minimum area rule. It's area
is 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49 which is less than 0.5.

DESCRIPTION
The above warnings can be seen during route_detail for nets which are already routed and
check_connectivity shows no opens but they have a FIXED segment and a trunk routing net
attribute.
NanoRoute does not support trunk routing for nets with FIXED wires. Changing the pre routed
segment to ROUTED or removing the nets trunk routing attribute or deleting the pre route will solve
the issue.
You may also be limiting the layer rang during an ECO route such that the route can not be
completed. Check the range of Bottom, Top limits and -route_only_layers option.
For example,

SUMMARY
Detail routing is stopped due to too many DRC violations.
DESCRIPTION
March 2020 752 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
This warning occurs when NanoRoute sees an abnormal number of DRC violations during initial
routing. It issues this warning and then stops so you can debug the violations to determine their
cause. To override this automatic stop you can set the drouteAutoStop option to false
Note: Since this can add significant run time you should only override this setting when you're
confident. NanoRoute will be able to resolve the violations and you have investigate the initial
violations and are pursuing remedies to the violation.
set_db route_design_detail_auto_stop false
There are several reasons NanoRoute may initial violations and stop:
1) Congestion - Review the global route congestion map to identify hot spots visually and reduce
the congestion in this area by reducing the placement density using partial placement blockages or
modifying the floorplan.
2) Pin access problems - Are the majority of violations on M1 and M2? If so, this can indicate pin
access problems on standard cell pins or a Tracking problem, or a power rail issue. Review the
violations at these pins and determine why they are occurring. For example, blockage is too close
to the pin, pin is off the routing track or a proper via is not defined which can be dropped to the pin.
3) Pins under power stripes - Are the violations occurring when trying to route to standard cells
placed under stripes? If so, use setPrerouteAsObs to treat these stripes as placement blockages.
For example, the following treats strips on M1, M2 and M3 as placement blockages:
setPrerouteAsObs {1 2 3}
If you standard cells pin on M2 being placed under M3 stripes you can set the following instead.
This will avoid placing M2 pins under M3 stripes but allow M1 standard cell pins to be place under
the M3 stripes:
setPlaceMode -checkPinLayerForAccess { 1 2 }
4) Routing layers too limited - Make sure you have not set the max routing layer too low.
5) Other library or design issues - Review warnings at the beginning of the NanoRoute run which
may indicate problems

SUMMARY
Some nets are not detail routed. Post-route operations (via_swapping, minimize detour, wire
widening, spreading, or matching) cannot be done. If possible, normal detail routing will be done.
DESCRIPTION
Post-route operations cannot be performed unless all the signal nets are completely routed. Disable
post-route options and then route the remaining nets using the route_design or route_eco
command. Only use route_eco if less than 10% of the signal nets are unrouted. Once all the nets
are routed you can then run post-route operations. The unrouted net can also be skipped using the
net attribute setting if there is some reason it is to remain incomplete.

Post-routing optimization is disabled because of too many DRC violations
DESCRIPTION
This warning occurs when NanoRoute sees too many violations in the post routing optimization
stage. To avoid this warning and force NanoRoute to continue "set_db
route_design_detail_auto_stop false" before routing.
Note: You should only override this setting when you're confident NanoRoute will be able to resolve
the violations. Otherwise, review the violations to determine the cause. It can be due to congestion,
pin access problems, bad design rules, improper via definitions, track missalignment etc. Ignoring
the violations causing the auto stop can lead to long runtime, timing problems, and the routing may
not complete.

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus could not find a path for net '%s' to reach '%s'. If the -topoFile option is
being used, the topology specified for this net is incomplete.
DESCRIPTION
In case automatic feedthrough insertion is being done, it means that a path to some of the terminals
could not be found. If the routeBased option is used, the routing may be incomplete. For the case
the topology file is used an explanation follows.
Tool issues above warning during add_partition_feedthrus command step, when topology file
provided with -topoFile is used to guide the tool for creating the feedthrough in a specified partition
for multi-fanout nets. You will get above warning if the topology file did not define for all the
terminals for a multi-fanout net. Always follow the convention from_pin to to_pin for writing the
topology file.
Example:
If the net goes to three partition A, B and C and you want to make a part of the net from A to D then
to C, then you can use the following approach to write the topology file.
net n123

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus is trying to find a feedthrough path for net %s. It could not find a path to
partition or terminal [%s]. Partitions connected to this net may not be adjacent to each other.
DESCRIPTION
Automatic feedthrough insertion derives the feedthrough topology using the placement. It assumes
a channel-less design. The possibility of routing through channels is considered minimal. In this
design a path to a partition or terminal connected to the above mentioned net could not be found
without avoiding the channels.

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus skipping net [%s] because a path to some of the partitions or terminals

DESCRIPTION
add_partition_feedthrus assumes the design to be channel-less and partitions to be in the line of
sight for feedthrough path to pass from one partition to another. In case of channel based designs
where this is not true, the named net is ignored. In case feedthrough insertion is required for the net,
either route the design and used add_partition_feedthrus -routeBased or define the path for the net
in a topology file and use add_partition_feedthrus -topoFile <filename>

SUMMARY
The add_partition_feedthrus command was invoked with the -routeBased option, but the design
has not yet been routed. The add_partition_feedthrus command will skip the nets that are not
routed. Route the design using route_early_global for these nets to be considered for feedthrough
insertion.
DESCRIPTION
The add_partition_feedthrus command invoked with the -routeBased option requires routing for the
net to find a path based on which it will insert the feedthrough ports.
The net reported is not routed so it gets ignored. Route the design prior to running this command.
The route_early_global command can be used to route the design.
Otherwise add_partition_feedthrus should be invoked without using the -routeBased option in
which case the command will try to find a path for the net based on the create_floorplan and
placement (placement based feedthrough insertion).

Error and Warning Messages
DESCRIPTION
This warning message is issued while assigning pins on a partition using the Innovus GUI with
Partition => Assign Pin... or when using the assign_partition_pins Tcl command.
The create_floorplan likely contains a problem with routing tracks and/or pin layer definitions. The
problem can be debugged graphically using: Partition => Specify Partition
Select the offending partition and review the Partition Pin Layer Used section. Make sure the layers
defined for pins are included in the Layers Reserved For Partition. Corrections may be made and
applied with this form. Check the min max layer allowed though get_db another reason could be
presence of route blockage or PG on partition edge blocking the routing tracks.
Next, confirm there are preferred routing tracks defined for the pin layers using the Layer Control =>
Track => Pref Track and the Wire&Via layer defined for the pins. If the tracks are incorrect, they may
be regenerated using the "generateTracks" Tcl command.
Example:
get_pin_constraint -cell c -side all -layer
Constraint on partition c :
Allowed layer on side [top] : 2 4 6
Allowed layer on side [left] : 3 5
Allowed layer on side [bottom] : 2 4 6

While corrections can be made to the tmp.fp file and reloaded with the "read_floorplan tmp.fp" Tcl

Pin [%s] of %s [%s] connected to net [%s] is [%s] at location (%8.3f, %8.3f) on layer %1d %s.
DESCRIPTION
Message reports specific error/violation on a partition pin.
Example of ABUTMENT violation on a pin:
---------------------------------------
Pin [pin_1] of partition [ptn_1] connected to net [net_1] is [PLACED] at location (210.452, 540.160)
on layer 8 has ABUTMENT violation WITH partition chip.
In above example error/violation is being reported for partition “ptn_1” pin's “pin_1” which is
connected to net “net_1” and is placed at location “210.452, 540.160” on layer “8” having
assignment status as “placed”. Pin has abutment (is placed on adjoining boundary of “ptn_1” and
“chip”) violation with partition named “chip”. Ideally the pin pair of two adjoining (abutting) partitions
should be placed on same track on edge of partition boundaries, touching each other (abutting).
Abutment violation could be because of following two reasons:
1. Net has multi-partition-pins. Since all other pins of different partitions cannot be placed at same
location (no electrical connection through any overlap of physical shape), so it is reported as
abutment violation.
2. “pin_1” pin of net “net_1” is not connected to any pin of adjoining (abutted) partition “chip”.

SUMMARY
The hierarchical-PG net %s is connected to an instance term %s inside the partition hinst %s.
However, it is not connected to any PG port of the partition hinst. This is erroneous data. As a

above net is connected to a partition PG port when connecting to an instance PG term inside the
partition, and run the command again.
DESCRIPTION
Reason of such incorrect PG net connection is generally introduced by either incorrect UPF or
incorrect GNC rule. To correct this error, ensure that the above net is connected to a partition PG
port when connecting to an instance PG term inside partition. Or, if this connection is not needed
inside the partition hinst, then ensure that the net does not connect to any of the PG terms inside the

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus could not find a path for net '%s' to reach '%s'. If the -topoFile option is
being used, the topology specified for this net is incomplete.
DESCRIPTION
In case automatic feedthrough insertion is being done, it means that a path to some of the terminals
could not be found. If the routeBased option is used, the routing may be incomplete. For the case
the topology file is used an explanation follows.
Tool issues above warning during add_partition_feedthrus command step, when topology file
provided with -topoFile is used to guide the tool for creating the feedthrough in a specified partition
for multi-fanout nets. You will get above warning if the topology file did not define for all the
terminals for a multi-fanout net. Always follow the convention from_pin to to_pin for writing the
topology file.
Example:
If the net goes to three partition A, B and C and you want to make a part of the net from A to D then
to C, then you can use the following approach to write the topology file.
net n123
hinst-hinst A D;
hinst-hinst D C;
hinst-hinst A B;
end net
So, here all the combinations are covered where the net goes, instead of defining the A-D-C.

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus is trying to find a feedthrough path for net %s. It could not find a path to
partition or terminal [%s]. Partitions connected to this net may not be adjacent to each other.
DESCRIPTION
Automatic feedthrough insertion derives the feedthrough topology using the placement. It assumes
a channel-less design. The possibility of routing through channels is considered minimal. In this
design a path to a partition or terminal connected to the above mentioned net could not be found
without avoiding the channels.

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus skipping net [%s] because a path to some of the partitions or terminals

insert feedthrough buffers for this net, then use the topology file for guided feedthrough buffer
insertion or use the -routeBased option after routing the net.

SUMMARY
The add_partition_feedthrus command was invoked with the -routeBased option, but the design
has not yet been routed. The add_partition_feedthrus command will skip the nets that are not
routed. Route the design using route_early_global for these nets to be considered for feedthrough
insertion.
DESCRIPTION
The add_partition_feedthrus command invoked with the -routeBased option requires routing for the
net to find a path based on which it will insert the feedthrough ports.
The net reported is not routed so it gets ignored. Route the design prior to running this command.
The route_early_global command can be used to route the design.
Otherwise add_partition_feedthrus should be invoked without using the -routeBased option in
which case the command will try to find a path for the net based on the create_floorplan and
placement (placement based feedthrough insertion).

SUMMARY
Ptn %s does not have any reserved slots for assigning ptn pins. Check the allowed layers for the

DESCRIPTION
This warning message is issued while assigning pins on a partition using the Innovus GUI with
Partition => Assign Pin... or when using the assign_partition_pins Tcl command.
The create_floorplan likely contains a problem with routing tracks and/or pin layer definitions. The
problem can be debugged graphically using: Partition => Specify Partition
Select the offending partition and review the Partition Pin Layer Used section. Make sure the layers
defined for pins are included in the Layers Reserved For Partition. Corrections may be made and
applied with this form. Check the min max layer allowed though get_db another reason could be
presence of route blockage or PG on partition edge blocking the routing tracks.
Next, confirm there are preferred routing tracks defined for the pin layers using the Layer Control =>

Error and Warning Messages
Example of ABUTMENT violation on a pin:
---------------------------------------
Pin [pin_1] of partition [ptn_1] connected to net [net_1] is [PLACED] at location (210.452, 540.160)
on layer 8 has ABUTMENT violation WITH partition chip.
In above example error/violation is being reported for partition “ptn_1” pin's “pin_1” which is
connected to net “net_1” and is placed at location “210.452, 540.160” on layer “8” having
assignment status as “placed”. Pin has abutment (is placed on adjoining boundary of “ptn_1” and
“chip”) violation with partition named “chip”. Ideally the pin pair of two adjoining (abutting) partitions
should be placed on same track on edge of partition boundaries, touching each other (abutting).
Abutment violation could be because of following two reasons:
1. Net has multi-partition-pins. Since all other pins of different partitions cannot be placed at same
location (no electrical connection through any overlap of physical shape), so it is reported as
abutment violation.
2. “pin_1” pin of net “net_1” is not connected to any pin of adjoining (abutted) partition “chip”.
List other violations on pin:
- pin min-width violation
- pin min-depth violation
- pin missing metal shape violation
- pin min-area violation
- pin-color violation
- pin not on routing track (or ndr-rule-routing-track) violation
- pin not on fence violation
- pin spacing (drc and spacing constraints) violation
- pin not on allowed layer violation
- For nested partition it checks for child fence area violation
- pin outside pin-guide or bus-guide violation
- Pin associated pin-group or net-group violation

had set either set_db or set_db for minLayer but has missed to set setDesignMode for minLayer,
and user would like to set min/max layer of pin that is different from route_early_global. Innovus
checks for this issue and generate the message as user may forget to set min/max layer of pin when
it differs from route_early_global.

Because of the following reason the ENCPTN-1802 is reported.
Message ENCPTN-1802 is generated to correct the user expectation, when user had set either

SUMMARY
The hierarchical-PG net %s is connected to an instance term %s inside the partition hinst %s.
However, it is not connected to any PG port of the partition hinst. This is erroneous data. As a
consequence, instance term %s will become unconnected. To correct this error, ensure that the
above net is connected to a partition PG port when connecting to an instance PG term inside the
partition, and run the command again.
DESCRIPTION
Reason of such incorrect PG net connection is generally introduced by either incorrect UPF or
incorrect GNC rule. To correct this error, ensure that the above net is connected to a partition PG
port when connecting to an instance PG term inside partition. Or, if this connection is not needed
inside the partition hinst, then ensure that the net does not connect to any of the PG terms inside the
partition hinst.

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus could not find a path for net '%s' to reach '%s'. If the -topoFile option is
being used, the topology specified for this net is incomplete.
DESCRIPTION
In case automatic feedthrough insertion is being done, it means that a path to some of the terminals
could not be found. If the routeBased option is used, the routing may be incomplete. For the case
the topology file is used an explanation follows.
Tool issues above warning during add_partition_feedthrus command step, when topology file
provided with -topoFile is used to guide the tool for creating the feedthrough in a specified partition
for multi-fanout nets. You will get above warning if the topology file did not define for all the
terminals for a multi-fanout net. Always follow the convention from_pin to to_pin for writing the
topology file.
Example:
If the net goes to three partition A, B and C and you want to make a part of the net from A to D then
to C, then you can use the following approach to write the topology file.
net n123
hinst-hinst A D;
hinst-hinst D C;

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus is trying to find a feedthrough path for net %s. It could not find a path to
partition or terminal [%s]. Partitions connected to this net may not be adjacent to each other.
DESCRIPTION
Automatic feedthrough insertion derives the feedthrough topology using the placement. It assumes
a channel-less design. The possibility of routing through channels is considered minimal. In this
design a path to a partition or terminal connected to the above mentioned net could not be found
without avoiding the channels.

NAME
PTNPART-647
SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus skipping net [%s] because a path to some of the partitions or terminals
could not be found. It might not be necessary to insert feedthrough buffers for this net. If you wish to
insert feedthrough buffers for this net, then use the topology file for guided feedthrough buffer
insertion or use the -routeBased option after routing the net.
March 2020 823 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
DESCRIPTION
add_partition_feedthrus assumes the design to be channel-less and partitions to be in the line of
sight for feedthrough path to pass from one partition to another. In case of channel based designs
where this is not true, the named net is ignored. In case feedthrough insertion is required for the net,
either route the design and used add_partition_feedthrus -routeBased or define the path for the net
in a topology file and use add_partition_feedthrus -topoFile <filename>
Example:
--------
route_early_global
add_partition_feedthrus -routeBased

SUMMARY
The add_partition_feedthrus command was invoked with the -routeBased option, but the design
has not yet been routed. The add_partition_feedthrus command will skip the nets that are not
routed. Route the design using route_early_global for these nets to be considered for feedthrough
insertion.
DESCRIPTION
The add_partition_feedthrus command invoked with the -routeBased option requires routing for the
net to find a path based on which it will insert the feedthrough ports.
The net reported is not routed so it gets ignored. Route the design prior to running this command.
The route_early_global command can be used to route the design.
Otherwise add_partition_feedthrus should be invoked without using the -routeBased option in
which case the command will try to find a path for the net based on the create_floorplan and
placement (placement based feedthrough insertion).

Error and Warning Messages
DESCRIPTION
This warning message is issued while assigning pins on a partition using the Innovus GUI with
Partition => Assign Pin... or when using the assign_partition_pins Tcl command.
The create_floorplan likely contains a problem with routing tracks and/or pin layer definitions. The
problem can be debugged graphically using: Partition => Specify Partition
Select the offending partition and review the Partition Pin Layer Used section. Make sure the layers
defined for pins are included in the Layers Reserved For Partition. Corrections may be made and
applied with this form. Check the min max layer allowed though get_db another reason could be
presence of route blockage or PG on partition edge blocking the routing tracks.
Next, confirm there are preferred routing tracks defined for the pin layers using the Layer Control =>
Track => Pref Track and the Wire&Via layer defined for the pins. If the tracks are incorrect, they may
be regenerated using the "generateTracks" Tcl command.
Example:
get_pin_constraint -cell c -side all -layer
Constraint on partition c :
Allowed layer on side [top] : 2 4 6
Allowed layer on side [left] : 3 5
Allowed layer on side [bottom] : 2 4 6
Allowed layer on side [right] : 3 5

design_bottom_routing_layer 2 # string, default=""
design_top_routing_layer 15 # string, default=""

Look for the Tracks in a section with: Track:
While corrections can be made to the tmp.fp file and reloaded with the "read_floorplan tmp.fp" Tcl
command, it is generally easier to do make changes with the Innovus GUI.

Pin [%s] of %s [%s] connected to net [%s] is [%s] at location (%8.3f, %8.3f) on layer %1d %s.
DESCRIPTION
Message reports specific error/violation on a partition pin.
Example of ABUTMENT violation on a pin:
---------------------------------------
Pin [pin_1] of partition [ptn_1] connected to net [net_1] is [PLACED] at location (210.452, 540.160)
on layer 8 has ABUTMENT violation WITH partition chip.
In above example error/violation is being reported for partition “ptn_1” pin's “pin_1” which is
connected to net “net_1” and is placed at location “210.452, 540.160” on layer “8” having
assignment status as “placed”. Pin has abutment (is placed on adjoining boundary of “ptn_1” and
“chip”) violation with partition named “chip”. Ideally the pin pair of two adjoining (abutting) partitions
should be placed on same track on edge of partition boundaries, touching each other (abutting).
Abutment violation could be because of following two reasons:
1. Net has multi-partition-pins. Since all other pins of different partitions cannot be placed at same
location (no electrical connection through any overlap of physical shape), so it is reported as
abutment violation.
2. “pin_1” pin of net “net_1” is not connected to any pin of adjoining (abutted) partition “chip”.

- pin min-width violation
- pin min-depth violation
- pin missing metal shape violation

SUMMARY
The hierarchical-PG net %s is connected to an instance term %s inside the partition hinst %s.
However, it is not connected to any PG port of the partition hinst. This is erroneous data. As a
consequence, instance term %s will become unconnected. To correct this error, ensure that the
above net is connected to a partition PG port when connecting to an instance PG term inside the
partition, and run the command again.
DESCRIPTION
Reason of such incorrect PG net connection is generally introduced by either incorrect UPF or
incorrect GNC rule. To correct this error, ensure that the above net is connected to a partition PG
port when connecting to an instance PG term inside partition. Or, if this connection is not needed
inside the partition hinst, then ensure that the net does not connect to any of the PG terms inside the
partition hinst.

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus could not find a path for net '%s' to reach '%s'. If the -topoFile option is
being used, the topology specified for this net is incomplete.
DESCRIPTION
In case automatic feedthrough insertion is being done, it means that a path to some of the terminals
could not be found. If the routeBased option is used, the routing may be incomplete. For the case
the topology file is used an explanation follows.
Tool issues above warning during add_partition_feedthrus command step, when topology file
provided with -topoFile is used to guide the tool for creating the feedthrough in a specified partition
for multi-fanout nets. You will get above warning if the topology file did not define for all the
terminals for a multi-fanout net. Always follow the convention from_pin to to_pin for writing the
topology file.
Example:
If the net goes to three partition A, B and C and you want to make a part of the net from A to D then
to C, then you can use the following approach to write the topology file.
net n123
hinst-hinst A D;
hinst-hinst D C;
hinst-hinst A B;
end net
So, here all the combinations are covered where the net goes, instead of defining the A-D-C.

SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus is trying to find a feedthrough path for net %s. It could not find a path to
partition or terminal [%s]. Partitions connected to this net may not be adjacent to each other.
DESCRIPTION
Automatic feedthrough insertion derives the feedthrough topology using the placement. It assumes
a channel-less design. The possibility of routing through channels is considered minimal. In this
design a path to a partition or terminal connected to the above mentioned net could not be found
without avoiding the channels.

NAME
PTNPIN-647
SUMMARY
add_partition_feedthrus skipping net [%s] because a path to some of the partitions or terminals
could not be found. It might not be necessary to insert feedthrough buffers for this net. If you wish to
insert feedthrough buffers for this net, then use the topology file for guided feedthrough buffer
insertion or use the -routeBased option after routing the net.
DESCRIPTION
add_partition_feedthrus assumes the design to be channel-less and partitions to be in the line of
sight for feedthrough path to pass from one partition to another. In case of channel based designs

NAME
PTNPIN-882
SUMMARY
The add_partition_feedthrus command was invoked with the -routeBased option, but the design
has not yet been routed. The add_partition_feedthrus command will skip the nets that are not
routed. Route the design using route_early_global for these nets to be considered for feedthrough
insertion.
DESCRIPTION
The add_partition_feedthrus command invoked with the -routeBased option requires routing for the
net to find a path based on which it will insert the feedthrough ports.
The net reported is not routed so it gets ignored. Route the design prior to running this command.
The route_early_global command can be used to route the design.
Otherwise add_partition_feedthrus should be invoked without using the -routeBased option in
which case the command will try to find a path for the net based on the create_floorplan and
placement (placement based feedthrough insertion).
Example:
--------
route_early_global

SUMMARY
Ptn %s does not have any reserved slots for assigning ptn pins. Check the allowed layers for the
partition and make sure that layers based on preferred routing tracks are reserved.
DESCRIPTION
This warning message is issued while assigning pins on a partition using the Innovus GUI with
Partition => Assign Pin... or when using the assign_partition_pins Tcl command.
The create_floorplan likely contains a problem with routing tracks and/or pin layer definitions. The
problem can be debugged graphically using: Partition => Specify Partition
Select the offending partition and review the Partition Pin Layer Used section. Make sure the layers
defined for pins are included in the Layers Reserved For Partition. Corrections may be made and
applied with this form. Check the min max layer allowed though get_db another reason could be
presence of route blockage or PG on partition edge blocking the routing tracks.
Next, confirm there are preferred routing tracks defined for the pin layers using the Layer Control =>

DESCRIPTION
Message reports specific error/violation on a partition pin.
March 2020 857 Product Version 20.10
 Innovus Stylus Common UI Error Message Reference
Error and Warning Messages
Example of ABUTMENT violation on a pin:
---------------------------------------
Pin [pin_1] of partition [ptn_1] connected to net [net_1] is [PLACED] at location (210.452, 540.160)
on layer 8 has ABUTMENT violation WITH partition chip.
In above example error/violation is being reported for partition “ptn_1” pin's “pin_1” which is
connected to net “net_1” and is placed at location “210.452, 540.160” on layer “8” having
assignment status as “placed”. Pin has abutment (is placed on adjoining boundary of “ptn_1” and
“chip”) violation with partition named “chip”. Ideally the pin pair of two adjoining (abutting) partitions
should be placed on same track on edge of partition boundaries, touching each other (abutting).
Abutment violation could be because of following two reasons:
1. Net has multi-partition-pins. Since all other pins of different partitions cannot be placed at same
location (no electrical connection through any overlap of physical shape), so it is reported as
abutment violation.
2. “pin_1” pin of net “net_1” is not connected to any pin of adjoining (abutted) partition “chip”.
List other violations on pin:
- pin min-width violation
- pin min-depth violation
- pin missing metal shape violation
- pin min-area violation
- pin-color violation
- pin not on routing track (or ndr-rule-routing-track) violation
- pin not on fence violation
- pin spacing (drc and spacing constraints) violation
- pin not on allowed layer violation
- For nested partition it checks for child fence area violation
- pin outside pin-guide or bus-guide violation
- Pin associated pin-group or net-group violation

checks for this issue and generate the message as user may forget to set min/max layer of pin when
it differs from route_early_global.

SUMMARY
The hierarchical-PG net %s is connected to an instance term %s inside the partition hinst %s.
However, it is not connected to any PG port of the partition hinst. This is erroneous data. As a
consequence, instance term %s will become unconnected. To correct this error, ensure that the
above net is connected to a partition PG port when connecting to an instance PG term inside the
partition, and run the command again.
DESCRIPTION
Reason of such incorrect PG net connection is generally introduced by either incorrect UPF or
incorrect GNC rule. To correct this error, ensure that the above net is connected to a partition PG
port when connecting to an instance PG term inside partition. Or, if this connection is not needed
inside the partition hinst, then ensure that the net does not connect to any of the PG terms inside the
partition hinst.

register/latch clock pins and the register/latch output pins along with associated check arcs and
delay arcs. Model extraction is terminating because this may lead to a very long runtime, a large
memory consumption and a large TLF size. Please use '-force' option to continue.

The large number of slew values usually arises from output-to-output paths due to secondary
loading effect. To account for the secondary loading, the number of slews is multiplied by the
number of primary load values and this product can become very large. To avoid this warning,
specify a higher tolerance value using -tolerance option.

SUMMARY
The '%s' to '%s' transition of arc from '%s' to '%s' have early delays greater than the late delays. This
may cause issue in timing analysis with the extracted model.
DESCRIPTION
The early delays becomes greater than the late delays in special scenarios like cycle / latency /
uncertainty adjustment, or greater early derated, or greater delays in early input libraries. As the
extracted model have two parallel arcs; one for early analysis and other for late analysis, In such
cases the early arcs being worst delay arc will be used for late analysis and vice-versa.
TAMODEL-310
NAME
TAMODEL-310
SUMMARY
The extracted model will be context dependent on clock frequencies, as multicycle path exception
for '%s' arc from '%s' to '%s' can not be pushed out.
DESCRIPTION
When multicycle paths exception on arcs between two pins can not pushed out, the cycle
adjustment is adjusted in the arcs delay itself. This cause the extracted model to be context clock
frequencies dependent. For such designs the model needs to be re-extracted whenever the clock

DESCRIPTION
If the worst path to an output port is coming from a transparent latch then tools traces backward the
latch to find the actual start point of data and stop at non-borrowing latch, flop or input port. In case
while tracing backward if there is a feedback loop in the latches, then no actual path is found. Such

SUMMARY
Path from '%s' of '%s' and captured by clock '%s' have pin-based clock uncertainties. These
constraints will not be a part of the generated ETM model as the global variable
'timing_extract_model_include_latency_and_uncertainty' has been set to false. Ensure that these
pin based uncertainty constraints are re-applied after stitching the ETM at the top level.
DESCRIPTION
Setting the global variable 'timing_extract_model_include_latency_and_uncertainty' to false means
that clock latency and uncertainty will not be a part of the generated ETM model. Both of these
constraints are expected to come from the clock waveforms of the top level when a design is
stitched together for timing analysis. However, the internal pin-based clock latency and certainty will
not come from the top level. So, if required, during timing analysis, you will need to reapply these
constraints when the design is stitched together using ETM models.

such cases, extending the capacitance range to the default value makes sense in order to calculate

SUMMARY
Default pin based clock uncertainty (without '-to' option) can not be converted to GCF, treating it as
a '-to' unceratinty.
DESCRIPTION
In PKS by default, an uncertainty specification on pin X is honored only at those registers or latches
where there is a path from pin X to both the data pin and the clock pin of the register or latch.
However, the -to option lifts this restriction and makes it applicable to all registers and latches
whose clock pin is in the transitive fanout of pin X. Since the default uncertainty can not be
converted to GCF, it treats default uncertainty in the same way as '-to' uncertainty.

For example, in 2-dimensional table lookup, The 'cell_rise' table expects template that contains The
'input_net_transition' and The 'total_output_net_capacitance' indices. If these two template index
types can not be found at the compile time of 'cell_rise' table, BuildGates will flag an error and exit.

DESCRIPTION
This warning is encountered if the following constructs are missing from the library.
input_threshold_pct_fall input_threshold_pct_rise output_threshold_pct_fall
output_threshold_pct_rise These constructs in the timing library define how the delay of the
characterized cells has been deduced. For example a input_threshold_pct_rise of 30 and
output_threshold_pct_rise of 60 means theat the delay value in the tables are the time difference
between the input rising to 30% of its values and output rising to 70% of its value. If these are
missing, then they are assumed to be 50% for both input and output and rise and fall. To avoid this

DESCRIPTION
This warning is encountered if the following constructs are missing from the library.
slew_lower_threshold_pct_fall slew_upper_threshold_pct_fall slew_lower_threshold_pct_rise
slew_upper_threshold_pct_rise These constructs in the timing libraries are the slew thresholds
which define how slew values are calculated. For example a slew_lower_threshold_pct_rise of 20
and slew_upper_threshold_pct_rise of 80 means that the time values present in the library were
written as if 'measured' at 20% of the signal and 80% of the signal, and the slew is represented as
their difference. If these are missing, they are assumed to be 40% -60% (measured) 10%-90%
(reported). The measured thresholds are the ones at which timing is actually measured from spice.
These can be then stretched to reported thresholds linearly, to generate the data in the timing
library. To avoid this warning make sure that the timing libraries have the correct slew threshold
values specified.

DESCRIPTION
Unspecified/zero capacitance value for input/inout pin/bus/bundle in cell(s) (<CellName>). This
may cause potential problems with delay calculation results\n\nOne or more input/inout
pin/bus/bundle in the indicated cell(s) <CellName> have unspecified or zero capacitance value
(considering the default input/inout capacitance values also). As per delay calculation tools'
requirement, the input/inout capacitance value should be non-zero. Check the input technology

SUMMARY
Both rise/fall_propagation and cell_rise/fall encountered.
DESCRIPTION
Both rise/fall_propagation and cell_rise/fall encountered. The input technology library has both
rise/fall_propagation and cell_rise/fall tables. This effectively means that two sets of
characterization points are used in the library. This is not supported in TLF. A workaround is to
replace rise/fall_propagation with cell_rise/fall (or vice-versa) depending on whether cell_rise/fall or
rise/fall_propagation derating factors are used. Check that the rise/fall_transitions are zero in such
cases. If not, then the above-mentioned workaround can not be used.

Three-state expression for pin '%s' in cell '%s' is missing or does not contain '%s', whereas, tri-state
paths exist from '%s' to '%s'.
DESCRIPTION
Three-state expression for pin (<outputPin>) in cell (<cellName>) is missing or does not contain
(<relatedPin>), whereas, tri-state paths exist from (<relatedPin>) to (<outputPin>).\n\nThe
'three_state' attribute for pin <outputPin> in cell <cellName> is either missing or does not contain
pin <relatedPin> in the three-state expression. But the timing group(s) inside pin <outputPin> with
<relatedPin> as input pin have timing_type as 'three_state_disable'. Hence tri-state paths
generated in such cases are (Z->0, Z->1, 1->Z and 0->Z transitions at output). But the active level of
the control pin <relatedPin> is not determined as the three-state expression does not contain this
pin. So the paths are generated for both the rise and fall transitions at control pin and it's pintype is
specified without active level. Verify whether the <relatedPin> is a Control High or Control Low pin.
