Ideally the pin pair of two adjoining (abutting) partitionsshould be placed on same track on edge of partition boundaries, touching each other (abutting).Abutment violation could be because of following two reasons:1. Net has multi-partition-pins. Since all other pins of different partitions cannot be placed at samelocation (no electrical connection through any overlap of physical shape), so it is reported asabutment violation.2. "pin_1" pin of net "net_1" is not connected to any pin of adjoining (abutted) partition "chip".List other violations on pin:- pin min-width violation- pin min-depth violation- pin missing metal shape violation- pin min-area violation- pin-color violation- pin not on routing track (or ndr-rule-routing-track) violation- pin not on fence violation- pin spacing (drc and spacing constraints) violation- pin not on allowed layer violation- For nested partition it checks for child fence area violation- pin outside pin-guide or bus-guide violation- Pin associated pin-group or net-group violation'

In this case, a signal pin that is either aninput or inout pin is missing the gate-area data.In CMOS, every signal pin that is an input or inout pin connects to a transistor gate. If there is nogate-area associated with this pin, then the library data is incomplete and process antenna rulescannot be checked for this pin correctly. The router and verification commands will assume this pinhas no transistor gate attached, and therefore does not need to be protected from process antennaviolations, which may result in real violations that are not fixed by the router or seen by theverification commands.The best way to avoid this warning is to add the correct antenna gate-area data to the library data.You can also use the suppressMessage command to turn off this warning message. This might beappropriate if you know the only library cells without antenna data are already protected by internaldiode cells (e.g. some blocks might be built this way). In that case, you would lose the possiblebenefit of those internal diode cells for any nets connected to the block input, which might cause therouter to add some unnecessary diode cells to protect other inputs attached to the same net. This issomewhat dangerous, because you might suppress messages for pins that are not protected.You can also turn off the warning if you believe antenna errors are rare for these pins in practice,and you will depend on final sign-off physical verification tools to find any errors, and repair themmanually.The following example shows the definition of antenna gate area in a LEF PIN statement:MACRO AND2CLASS CORE;SIZE 0.90 BY 1.114 ;SYMETRY X Y ;SITE CORE ;PIN A1DIRECTION INPUT ;ANTENNAGATEAREA 0.002320 ; #antenna gate area in um^2PORTLAYER M1 ;RECT 0.188 0.196 0.234 0.426 ;ENDEND A1...END AND2'

When saving the design to OpenAccess (write_db orwrite_oa) via definitions of these vias need to be added to the technology library if they cannotbe defined in a parameterized form using standard vias from the OpenAccess technology file. Tosee if the via is defined in parameterized form, use write_def to create a DEFfile and look for vias in the VIAS section that are defined using the + RECTsyntax instead of + VIARULE syntax.If the vias cannot be represented by standard vias then a new custom via must becreated which requires writing to a technology file. Therefore, you must havewrite permissions or allowed to do an incremental update of the technologylibrary.Since the technology database needs to be incrementally updated, the recommended method is tocreatelocal technology database in design library either using \'create_oa_lib -oa_reference_tech_libs\' or\'set_db-oa_lib_create_mode reference\' option. For example:create_oa_lib myLib -oa_reference_tech_libs myRefLibset init_oa_design_lib myLibOrset_db -oa_lib_create_mode referenceThen define the place and route technology rules in myRefLib by importing atechnology LEF. This creates a local technology database in the design librarythat can be modified incrementally. Overall, when setting up your mixed-signaldesign environment we recommend using a Base PDK which contains the basetechnology file and an incremental technology database (ITDB) which references theBase PDK.

'full' : r'How do I control which extractor is used to generate spef file?It seems the behavior of set_db extract_rc_engine and extract_rc_effort_level have changedindicated by the warnings above. Using set_db options extract_rc_engine andextract_rc_effort_level to control which extractor is used by extract_rc is described below.The extract_rc_engine option indicates whether to use the preRoute or postRoute extractionengine. The extract_rc_engine values default, detail and CCE are now obsolete.Use extract_rc_engine preRoute when the design has not been detail routed by NanoRoute yet.This is equivalent to extract_rc_enginee default in previous versions of Innovus. Whenextract_rc_engine preRoute is set RC extraction is done by the fast density measurements of thesurrounding wires; coupling is not reported.Use extract_rc_engine postRoute after the design has been detail routed by NanoRoute.RCextraction is done by the detailed measurement of the distance to the surrounding wires; coupling isreported. The effortLevel parameter further specifies which postRoute engine is used for balancingperformance versus accuracy needs.The extract_rc_effort_level value controls which extractor is used when the postRoute engine isused.low - Invokes the native detailed extraction engine. This is the same as specifying theextract_rc_engine postRoute setting.medium - Invokes the Turbo QRC (TQRC) extraction mode. TQRC performance and accuracy fallsbetween native detailed extraction and IQRC engine. This engine supports distributed processing.TQRC engine is recommended for process nodes < 65nm. Note: This setting does not require aQRC license.high - Invokes the Integrated QRC (IQRC) extraction engine. IQRC provides superior accuracycompared to TQRC. IQRC is recommended for extraction after ECO. In addition, IQRC supportsdistributed processing.Note: IQRC requires a QRC license.signoff - Invokes the Standalone QRC extraction engine. This engine choice provides the highestaccuracy. The engine has several runModes, thereby,providing maximum flexibility.The default value depends on the value of setDesignMode. The default for nodes above 65nm islow. TQRC (effortLevel medium) is the default extraction engine in the postroute flow for 65 nm andbelow design. However, TQRC and IQRC do not support the obsoleted 3 corner flow(defineRCCorner flow) and require a QRCTechfile. Therefore, Native Detailed (effortLevel low)engine remains the default engine if no QRCTechfile has been defined or if the defineRCCornercommand has been used.Should you use Turbo QRC (tQRC) or standalone QRC?The extraction time with tQRC is typically a small percentage of the total flow time. With standaloneQRC, the runtime would be longer.Standalone QRC requires the usage of a QRC license (tQRC uses the Innovus license). It writesout a DEF and invokes the standalone tool. It is slower than tQRC. It is not incremental like tQRC,so the runtime impact may be high. tQRC is incremental and if changes are small, extractionruntime drops to almost zero. The delta between standalone QRC and tQRC in terms of accuracy istypically small, so there is usually no flow advantage or end QoR gain by doing it.Cadence\'s suggestion is to use TurboQRC for 65nm and below nodes in the postRoute flow, andfor signoff use standalone QRC.Note: setSIMode -extractionEngine is obsolete and extraction during SI fixing will use the values ofset_db extract_rc_engine and extract_rc_effort_level to determine the extractor to use.'

NanoRoute will be able to resolve the violations and you have investigate the initialviolations and are pursuing remedies to the violation.set_db route_design_detail_auto_stop falseThere are several reasons NanoRoute may initial violations and stop:1) Congestion - Review the global route congestion map to identify hot spots visually and reducethe congestion in this area by reducing the placement density using partial placement blockages ormodifying the floorplan.2) Pin access problems - Are the majority of violations on M1 and M2? If so, this can indicate pinaccess problems on standard cell pins or a Tracking problem, or a power rail issue. Review theviolations at these pins and determine why they are occurring. For example, blockage is too closeto the pin, pin is off the routing track or a proper via is not defined which can be dropped to the pin.3) Pins under power stripes - Are the violations occurring when trying to route to standard cellsplaced under stripes? If so, use setPrerouteAsObs to treat these stripes as placement blockages.For example, the following treats strips on M1, M2 and M3 as placement blockages:setPrerouteAsObs {1 2 3}If you standard cells pin on M2 being placed under M3 stripes you can set the following instead.This will avoid placing M2 pins under M3 stripes but allow M1 standard cell pins to be place underthe M3 stripes:setPlaceMode -checkPinLayerForAccess { 1 2 }4) Routing layers too limited - Make sure you have not set the max routing layer too low.5) Other library or design issues - Review warnings at the beginning of the NanoRoute run whichmay indicate problems'
